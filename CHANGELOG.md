# Changelog

This file starts at v1.0.0. Before it there was no compatibility promise to describe — neither for
the language nor for the `.lyrbc` format — and a changelog written under those conditions records
churn rather than change. The pre-1.0 releases carry their notes in their annotated tags.

Versions follow `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, as described in [README](README.md#versioning). Each entry
lists what changed **for someone using the toolchain**: the language, the standard library, the
bytecode format, the command line and the embedding API. Compiler internals are in `git log`.

## v3.4.0 — 2026-08-24

### Added

- **A chain can be started from an array, a range, or a table with holes in it.** `std.iter`
  gains four entrances:

  ```lyr
  over(xs).map(f)                 // an array
  range(1, 4)                     // what '1..4' walks in a loop
  rangeInclusive(1, 4)            // what '1..=4' walks
  compact(slots).map(f)           // the non-null values of a '(?T)[]'
  ```

  The adapters have been methods since 2.17, but the three built-in forms could not start a
  pipeline: an array and a string have no declaration to hang an `Iterable` conformance on, and a
  range is not a value at all — `a..b` is a loop head, so `(a..b).iter()` is not something that
  could exist. Naming the machinery by hand was the alternative, and a class literal with two
  fields reads worse than the loop it replaces.

  **`rangeInclusive` is its own function rather than `range(low, high + 1)`**, for the reason the
  two adapters behind it are separate: at the type's maximum that `+ 1` wraps and the chain
  yields nothing.

  **`compact` takes an ARRAY, not an iterator**, and that is the whole design. An `Iterator<?T>`
  cannot exist — `next()` answers `?T` and spends `null` on "the end", so an optional element
  would need `??T`, and `?` does not nest. Reading the slots directly is what makes the
  distinction available. It is lazy like every other adapter.

## v3.3.0 — 2026-08-24

### Fixed

- **A module that only CALLS through an interface no longer fails to load.** A library — an
  interface, a class calling through it, and the implementing left to whoever imports it —
  produced a `.lyrbc` its own loader refused:

  ```
  function 'kit.props.Field.take' at 70: stack depth 5 exceeds the declared maximum of 4
  ```

  The bytecode was correct. The loader reads a `callvirt`'s argument count off an Impls row,
  because every implementation of a slot shares its signature and the Types section carries slot
  names alone; with nothing implementing the interface there is no row, and the missing count was
  answered with "no arguments, no result". A two-argument call then looked as though it left its
  arguments on the stack, which is why the message named a function far from the call and moved
  when unrelated statements were deleted.

  Such a call cannot execute — `mkiface` is already refused without a row for exactly that pair,
  so no value of the interface can exist — and the loader now says so by stopping rather than
  guessing: everything up to the call is checked, and the rest of that block is not claimed to be.
  Where a row exists nothing changes.

- **Iterating an array of optionals is a message, not a crash** (`LYR-SEM0091`).
  `for (h in houses)` over a `(?House)[]` — an ordinary table shape — crashed the compiler in
  debug (`optnone of ?i64 — optionals do not nest`, with a stack trace and no position) and, in
  release, made `check` answer "ok" for a program `build` could not finish.

  The cause is the protocol, not the container: `next()` answers `?T` and uses null to mean "the
  end", so an optional element would need `??T` to be told apart from it, and `?` does not nest.
  The message says that and points at the loop that does work — over the indices. It fires the
  same way for an iterator of optionals handed in directly, because the reason is the same.

- **An operator whose operand already reported stays silent.** `<error>[]` appeared in sentences
  about operators: `IsError` was consulted where the error sat INSIDE an array or a tuple, so the
  type was not itself the error and the check went on to complain about it.

- **A range outside a loop head is a message, not a crash** (`LYR-SEM0090`). `let r = 1..5;` and
  `[1..3]` threw an internal exception out of the lowering, with a stack trace and no source
  position. A range is a loop head and not a value — the grammar has no range expression among its
  primaries and there is no range type — but nothing said so where the type was INFERRED; where it
  was written down, the assignment had refused it all along. The grammar now names the form and
  its one legal position.

- **The compiler reads back every module it writes.** The emit step was taken for mechanical, so
  nothing checked it: a `.lyrbc` its own loader refuses was found by a golden-image test that
  opened a window, two layers from the change. The bytes now go through the loader before a build
  writes them, in release as in debug — the one time it mattered, compiler and runtime were the
  same released build. A module that fails is a compiler bug and is reported as one, with the
  loader's own words.

- **An aliased import used only as a TYPE is no longer reported as unused.** `import kit.eye as
  look;` mentioned once, as `eye: look.Eye`, warned `LYR-SEM0072` — a build error under
  `--deny-warnings`. The qualifier of a type path has no node of its own, so neither reference
  table carried it; the resolver records the step-through now. A plain import used as a type and
  an alias used in an expression were already counted, which is what made the gap read as
  arbitrary.

- **`LYR-IR0001` says one sentence instead of two grown together.** The category was appended as a
  clause, and where a message ended in a subordinate one the result was
  *"initializer omits field 'wood', which has no default is not supported by this compiler version
  yet"*. The message names the construct; the category is a note beneath it.

- **A keyword written where a name belongs says so.** `keep.resume();` reported `expected member
  name after '.', got Resume` — the way a parser talks about a typo, which costs a reader a look at
  the spelling before they suspect the word. The identifier expectations now carry a note:

  ```
  note: 'resume' is a keyword and cannot be used as a name
  ```

  Only those: `got Return` where a `;` was expected is not a naming problem.

### Added

- **`lyric check <file> --emit`** answers the question plain `check` cannot: not "does this
  program compile" but "does the module it produces LOAD". It emits, reads back, and writes
  nothing. For a project that compiles every one of its files as an entry — to read each file's
  attributes — that was the missing invariant.

## v3.2.0 — 2026-08-23

### Added

- **A host can read and write a module's globals**: `LoadedProgram.GlobalCount`, `ReadGlobal(int)`
  and `WriteGlobal(int, LyrValue)`.

  For a TOOL. A program reaches its own globals with an instruction and needs none of this; a
  debugger's Globals scope, or an editor showing a running game what it is holding, had no way in
  at all. The names and types were already there — `GlobalNames` from the debug section, `Globals`
  for the types, `FieldNames` for what is inside an object — so this is the one piece that was
  missing.

  **Nothing checks the type on write.** A slot is a bit pattern and the program reads it as
  whatever its instructions expect, so writing a float where an integer stands produces a number
  nobody can explain rather than an error. `Module.Globals` carries the types; a tool is expected
  to have looked.

## v3.1.0 — 2026-08-23

### Added

- **Packed programs run on macOS** (#54). `lyric pack` produced a working executable on Windows
  and Linux and a dead one on macOS: a Mach-O declares its own extent in its load commands, and
  bytes beyond it make the file fail strict validation — the loader killed it before it started.

  The payload is now folded into the file instead of following it. The stub's signature is
  dropped and its load command removed, the payload takes that space, `__LINKEDIT` — the segment
  that ends every Mach-O — is grown so its extent reaches the new end, and
  `/usr/bin/codesign --force --sign -` signs the result ad-hoc. The signature says the file has
  not changed since packing, which is what the loader asks; distributing to other people's
  machines remains a question of notarisation with your own identity.

  Two consequences worth knowing:

  - **the footer is no longer last on macOS** — the signature follows it. The reader tries the
    end of the file first, as before, and otherwise scans backwards for the magic within a
    bounded window, checking each candidate whole;
  - **packing a macOS program needs macOS.** The signature is the half only that platform can
    make, so packing one elsewhere is refused with that reason rather than writing a file the
    loader would kill. Packing ON macOS FOR another platform works as it always did.

  The pack-and-run gate in both workflows now runs the packed program on macOS too, and verifies
  its signature — the part no test elsewhere can answer.

## v3.0.2 — 2026-08-23

### Fixed

- **The build sometimes produced a `lyric pack` that could not pack** (#101). Intermittent on
  Linux, on an unchanged tree, and the message pointed at the packer — where nothing was wrong.

  The driver copies the tools into its own output directory so that "beside itself" means the same
  during development as after an install. It learned their directories by BUILDING them a second
  time (`<MSBuild Targets="Build">` with its own set of global properties), then listing what came
  out. Two things were wrong with that. A second build under different properties is a second
  project INSTANCE, writing the same output directory as the first. And the listing was not ordered
  against the stub: `lyrpack` publishes its single-file stub from an `AfterTargets`, which in the
  failing run landed **169 ms after the driver had finished building** — into a directory the
  driver had already read.

  The directories are now derived by convention instead of asked for, which removes the second
  instance; the stub publish is invoked explicitly before the listing, which orders it; and the
  target now **fails the build** when the stub did not arrive, rather than leaving it to be
  discovered by a packing test half a minute later.

  That last part earned itself immediately: the first derived path forgot that a publish FOR a
  platform writes to `bin/<config>/<tfm>/<rid>/`, so the release build copied nothing — and said
  so, in the build, instead of shipping an archive whose driver could not pack.

## v3.0.1 — 2026-08-23

**The first sweep after the major**, and the reason the pipeline now has one: four defects, none
of which a test had asked about, all in what the new features do to EACH OTHER.

### Fixed

- **Static methods did not overload.** `Id.of(7)` beside `Id.of("seven")` took the first
  declaration and then failed to type the argument. A static call names the type rather than
  standing on a value of it, and the candidate lookup read the receiver as a value type — finding
  nothing, so no choice was ever made.

- **Two conformances satisfied by two overloads compiled to the wrong call.** A type may conform
  to `Equatable<Tag>` and `Equatable<int>` and satisfy both with two `equals`; the vtable rows are
  built per instance, and both resolved the method by NAME, so both rows pointed at the first one.
  The conformance check had already decided which implementation belongs to which conformance, and
  the lowering now reads that answer instead of asking the name. Caught by the IR verifier as a
  type mismatch, which is not what it looks like — without it, a silent wrong call through an
  interface value.

- **A broken argument in an overloaded call hid its own error.** Choosing an overload means typing
  the arguments before a candidate is known, and that typing is muted so that mismatches against
  the wrong candidate are not reported. An argument that does not type at ALL was muted with them,
  and the reader got "no overload takes (`<error>`)" — a consequence, with the cause swallowed.
  Such an argument is now re-checked out loud and nothing else is reported: the poison rule the
  rest of the checker follows.

- **Two overloaded extension methods were an ambiguity.** `LYR-SEM0044` fired whenever two visible
  extensions shared a member name, which was right before overloading and wrong after it. It now
  fires when two of them share a name AND their parameters, which is the case nothing can tell
  apart.

### Documentation

- Guide 13 no longer says the language has no overloading. The `minInt`/`clampInt` family keeps
  its names — they were chosen when that was true — and the chapter says so rather than pretending
  the reason still holds.
- Guide 19 listed `LYR-SEM0074` among the warnings and promised it would become an error "in a
  future major version". It became one in 2.0.
- Guide 3 gains where overloading works (statics and extensions included), that an import brings
  the whole set, and that `@Deprecated` sits on one overload rather than on the name.

## v3.0.0 — 2026-08-23

**The major.** Everything the 2.x line had deferred, in one release: heterogeneous arithmetic,
throwability that survives being stored, overloading, and a compiler that turns hot functions into
machine code. The `.lyrbc` format is unchanged at **3.6** — a 3.0.0 module loads in a 2.12 runtime
and the other way round, as far as the language allows.

**Migrating from 2.x**, in the order the compiler will tell you:

1. every `Add<T>` / `Sub<T>` / `Mul<T>` / `Div<T>` gains a second type argument, the RESULT:
   `Add<Vec2, Vec2>`. The compiler names the count (`LYR-SEM0026`);
2. a coroutine whose body may throw is a different TYPE now — `Coroutine<int> throws Exception` —
   and a field or optional holding one says so;
3. the eleven forms whose `@Deprecated` promised removal at 3.0 are gone: `readText`, `readBytes`,
   `readLines` and the eight free iterator adapters. Their replacements have been there since
   2.14 and 2.17.

Nothing else in a 2.x program changes meaning.

### Changed — breaking

- **The arithmetic interfaces take two type arguments.** `Add<T>` is now `Add<T, R>`, likewise
  `Sub`, `Mul` and `Div`: what stands on the right of the operator, and what the operation gives
  back. Every existing conformance and constraint gains a second argument, and the compiler names
  the count (`LYR-SEM0026`):

  ```lyr
  struct Vec2 :: [Add<Vec2, Vec2>] { … }        // was: [Add<Vec2>]
  fn total<T :: [Add<T, T>]>(a: T, b: T): T     // was: <T :: [Add<T>]>
  ```

  The result could not be read off the operand, or `Vec2 * 2.0` would have to give a `float`.

- **Every deprecation whose promise named 3.0 is gone.** The `until` field is a commitment, and
  this is the release it comes due in. Eleven forms:

  | gone | use |
  |---|---|
  | `std.io.file.readText` | `text` |
  | `std.io.file.readBytes` | `bytes` |
  | `std.io.file.readLines` | `lines` |
  | `std.iter.map/filter/take/skip/takeWhile/zip/chain/flatMap` (free) | the methods of `Iterator<T>` |

  The free iterator adapters have been the methods' delegates since 2.17; `enumerate` and `chunks`
  stay free, and the comment in `std/iter.lyr` says why (a non-generic method changing the element
  type does not monomorphize).

- **The toolchain calls itself 3.0.0.** The tree carries the version the language it speaks
  belongs to, so the specification suite runs the right cases against it.

### Added

- **Overloading**: several functions may share a name, told apart by their parameters.

  ```lyr
  fn describe(n: int): string { … }
  fn describe(s: string): string { … }
  fn describe(a: int, b: int): string { … }
  ```

  The second answer this language has to "one name, several types" — generics with constraints
  being the first — and admitted deliberately, which is why its rules are written out in the
  specification (§4.3a) rather than left to be discovered.

  **The arguments choose, and only the arguments.** Not the result type: a call has to mean one
  thing before anyone looks at where it goes. Where several fit, the one that needs least wins, in
  this order: an exact type beats a literal that adapts; a concrete parameter beats a type
  parameter; no defaults beats defaults; non-variadic beats variadic; and a type's own method beats
  an extension that fits equally well — the rule that predates overloading, last so it decides
  nothing a parameter could decide. Nothing fitting is `LYR-SEM0087`, a tie is `LYR-SEM0086`, and
  both name every candidate they weighed.

  Functions, methods and extension methods overload. **Interface members do not** (`LYR-SEM0088`):
  a method table holds one function per slot and finds it by name. Two functions with the SAME
  parameters are a redeclaration however their results differ (`LYR-SEM0085`). A lambda argument
  takes no part in choosing, having no type until a parameter gives it one.

  Used as a VALUE rather than called, an overloaded name is picked by the type it is wanted as —
  `twice(describe, 7)` takes the `fn(int) -> string` one — and refused where nothing says which
  (`LYR-SEM0089`).

  In the compiled module the overloads carry their parameters in the name (`main.show(int)` beside
  `main.show(string)`), because function names are unique there. A name declared once is unchanged,
  so a program without overloads compiles to the bytes it always did. A host calling by name
  matches on the argument count and says so when that is not enough.

- **A type may conform to one arithmetic interface several times**, and the operator picks the
  conformance by the type of its **right operand**. This is the one exception to "one conformance
  per interface" in the language:

  ```lyr
  struct Vec2 :: [Mul<Vec2, Vec2>] {
      x: float, y: float,
      fn mul(other: Vec2): Vec2 { … }
  }

  extend Vec2 :: [Mul<float, Vec2>] {
      fn mul(other: float): Vec2 { … }          // scaling, its own conformance
  }

  let scaled = v * 2.0;                          // Mul<float, Vec2>
  let square = v * v;                            // Mul<Vec2, Vec2>
  ```

  Both implementations are called `mul`, so the NAME never decides — which is also the limit of
  it: a written `v.mul(2.0)` stays ambiguous, because a call has only the name to go on. Free
  overloading is a separate feature and comes in v3.1.0.

  What this touches, since a name no longer identifies a method: conformance checking asks whether
  ANY visible method matches the signature the conformance demands; vtable rows are built per
  interface INSTANCE rather than per interface, so `Mul<float, Vec2>` and `Mul<Vec2, Vec2>` get
  their own row and an interface value dispatches to the one it names; and a call under a
  constraint goes through that row, so the constraint decides which conformance a generic body
  means.

- **An untyped integer literal adapts to the conformance's operand type**: with `Mul<float, Vec2>`
  in reach, `v * 2` multiplies by `2.0`, under the same literal rule as everywhere else. An exact
  conformance wins over an adapted one.

- **`LYR-SEM0083`** — two conformances taking the same operand and disagreeing on what to call.
  Reported where the operator is used, not at the declaration: a conformance another module's
  `extend` block adds first meets the others where both are visible.

---

### Fixed

- **A generic interface member called on an instance of a generic class.**
  `ArrayIterator<int>.zip<string>(…)` did not compile: the receiver took the instance path, which
  binds the OWNER's type parameters and not the member's own, so `Iterator<(T, B)>` reported "this
  type argument is not supported" — at the interface's declaration, which is not where the program
  was wrong. Such a call is lifted into the interface now, as the same call on an `Iterator<T>`
  value always was. It surfaced when the free adapters went: `zip` as a method had never been
  reachable in a test.

- **Scripts can run compiled.** `HostOptions.Compile = true` and each function is compiled to IL
  the first time it is called; a loop over `float`s stops being limited by the VM and starts being
  limited by the CPU.

  ```csharp
  var vm = new LangVm(new HostOptions { Capabilities = Capability.None, Compile = true });
  ```

  **Off by default, and opt-in is the whole design.** Compiled code has no instruction boundaries:
  a debugger cannot stop inside it and a budget cannot count it. So the shape is develop on the
  interpreter — breakpoints, stepping and hot reload all work there — and ship with this on.

  It is not a decision per call. A call carrying an `ExecutionBudget`, and any call under a
  debugger, stays interpreted even with the option set, so a host may turn it on for a whole VM and
  still meter the foreign code inside it. Compilation is per function and refusal is normal: what
  the compiler does not understand the interpreter keeps, which costs speed and never correctness.
  `ScriptInstance.CompiledFunctions` and `ScriptInstance.Refusals` say what happened, the second as
  short phrases meant to be tallied rather than read.

  Compiled today: arithmetic, comparisons, branches, locals, globals, arrays, fields, optionals,
  interface values, object construction, string constants and comparison, and calls — to a native,
  or to another function that compiles. Declined: closures, exceptions, enums, recursion, and the
  narrow integer widths.

  **Ahead-of-time publishing and this are alternatives, not a pair**: emitting IL at run time needs
  a runtime that can, and a NativeAOT build cannot. There every function is declined with `no
  runtime code generation` and every script is interpreted — nothing else changes.


- **A coroutine's throwability is part of its TYPE** (#73). `fn gen(): Coroutine<int> throws
  Exception` produces a `Coroutine<int> throws Exception`, and that type keeps its demand through
  a field, an optional, a parameter and a return:

  ```lyr
  class Runner {
      current: ?Coroutine<int> throws Exception = null,
  }
  ```

  The clause was checked at the **call** until 3.0 — the one event that runs no body and therefore
  cannot throw. It looked right while the coroutine stayed a local beside its `try`, and the demand
  vanished the moment it reached a field or an optional; the exception then left the entry point
  and ended the program with `LYR-VM0010`. A coroutine held in a field is the idiom coroutines were
  built for.

  What changed for a program that compiled before:

  - the **call** of a coroutine function demands nothing;
  - every **pull** — `resume` and `next()` alike — of a throwing coroutine is a throw site
    (`LYR-SEM0034`). `next()` is lenient about exhaustion, never about throwing;
  - a throwing coroutine no longer fits a plain `Coroutine<T>` slot. The other direction is fine: a
    coroutine that cannot throw keeps the promise a `throws` slot makes;
  - the type is written with a suffix wherever a type is written — `?Coroutine<int> throws
    Exception` — and `throws` alone means any `Throwable`. On anything but a coroutine it is
    refused (`LYR-SEM0084`): every other value runs at its call, where the callee's own clause
    already says what it throws.

  Purely static — the IR, the bytecode and the runtime are untouched.

---

## v2.17.0 — 2026-08-22

**M33 — iterator chaining.** The last thing this project had written down as a documented No.

```lyr
xs.iter().map<int>((n: int) => n * 2).filter((n: int) => n > 4).take(2)
```

### Added

- **An interface member may have type parameters of its own**, and it is not dispatched: a method
  table holds one function per slot, and such a member is one function per instantiation. It gets
  **no slot** and is monomorphized, like a generic function. Three rules follow, and they are one
  fact seen from three sides (`LYR-SEM0082`):

  - it must have a **body** — an abstract one would promise a dispatch nothing can perform;
  - it may not be **overridden** — without a slot the target is chosen by the receiver's static
    type, so an override would be reached through the concrete type and the default through the
    interface: one name, two functions;
  - it is reachable through a **constraint AND through an interface value** — which is what a
    chain needs, and is sound *because* of the first two.

  The same trade Rust makes for a provided method with type parameters of its own.

- **A default method of a GENERIC interface is lowered at all.** `interface Source<T> { fn twice():
  T { … } }` did not compile: three places lifted a receiver into the interface DEFINITION, which
  has no entry, and reported that `Source` needs a type argument — at the interface's own
  declaration, which is not where the program was wrong. All three take the instance now.

- **`std.iter` adapters are methods**: `map`, `filter`, `take`, `skip`, `takeWhile`, `zip`,
  `chain`, `flatMap`. The free forms delegate to them — one implementation — and carry
  `until = "3.0"`.

### The two that stay free, and why

- `sum`, `sumFloat`, `minValue`, `maxValue` ask something of the ELEMENT type, and an interface
  cannot require that of its own parameter.
- `enumerate` and `chunks` change the element type without being generic. A method like that has a
  slot every instance must fill, so `Iterator<T>` would demand `Iterator<(int, T)>`, and that one
  the next — **the monomorphization does not terminate**. It was tried; the compiler stopped
  answering. `map` and `flatMap` change the element type safely because they are generic: built
  per use rather than per instance.

### Fixed

- **A non-terminating monomorphization is a diagnostic instead of a hang.** The lowering now
  reports it with the advice that fixes it — write the method as a free function — where it
  previously ran until the machine gave up, or produced a module the verifier rejected by naming a
  type nobody wrote.

- **The vtable rows are built to a fixed point.** A row can request a method whose body interns
  further types; one pass left those types without rows of their own.

## v2.16.0 — 2026-08-22

An interface may declare several parents. The rule that said otherwise rested on a claim about the
runtime, and the claim was wrong.

### Added

- **Several parent interfaces**: `interface Item :: [Counted, Scaled]`. Conforming to the child
  implies conforming to every ancestor, as before.

  The old rule read: *a parent's default method needs its own slot indexes to remain valid behind
  a child-typed receiver, so several parents would need thunks.* **They do not.** A vtable is
  keyed by the pair (concrete type, interface), and an implementing type gets a row for every
  interface in the transitive closure — every ancestor keeps its own numbering and nothing is
  remapped. The rule went when the reasoning was measured instead of repeated: lifted
  experimentally, probed, then built.

- **What a second parent actually costs**, and it is the second half of a rule that already
  existed (`LYR-SEM0079`): two parents may not contribute the same member name from DIFFERENT
  declarations. One slot holds one method, and no rule picks correctly between two. Before the
  check they were silently merged, which is worse than either answer.

  A name reached twice through a **diamond** is neither ambiguous nor refused: both paths lead to
  one declaration, so there is nothing to pick, and an implementation supplies it once.

### Changed

- `LYR-SEM0078` no longer includes "more than one parent"; `LYR-SEM0079` gains the clash. Three
  conformance cases replace the one that pinned the old rule — including a default on the SECOND
  parent running behind a child receiver, which is the case the old reasoning said would break.

## v2.15.0 — 2026-08-22

Two small things off the list before v3, both of the same kind: something written in the source
that the compiler looked past.

### Fixed

- **A `::` list takes interfaces only.** `struct S :: [Vec2]` was SKIPPED — the entry resolved to
  something that is not an interface, and the check moved on. The declaration claimed a
  conformance nothing verified and nothing reported, which is the quietest way for a mistake to
  survive a compiler. It is `LYR-SEM0078` now, on struct, class, enum and `extend` alike; the code
  already meant exactly this for an interface's parent list, so the catalogue entry is widened
  rather than a second number spent on the same sentence.

### Added

- **An interface member may carry `@Deprecated`.** It was refused because a conformance question
  had no answer: *do implementations inherit the clock?*

  **They do not.** A use that resolves to the interface's member warns; an implementation does
  not — an implementation is not a use, and a conforming type MUST implement what the interface
  requires, so a warning there could not be acted on without breaking conformance. A call on a
  concrete receiver resolves to the concrete method, which is its own declaration and carries its
  own deprecation or none.

  The member restriction is unchanged: only `@Deprecated`, because the module format has no member
  rows. An attribute on the interface DECLARATION is still refused.

  Two tests that pinned the old refusal now pin the new rule. They were right to exist: that is
  what a pin is for — it made the change a decision instead of a drift.

## v2.14.0 — 2026-08-22

The second link of the patch train. `std.io.file` had three conventions for "it did not work",
and one of them could not be told from success.

### Added

- **A read answers `?T`.** `text`, `bytes` and `lines` replace `readText`, `readBytes` and
  `readLines`:

  | | before | now |
  |---|---|---|
  | the file is empty | `[]` | `[]` |
  | the file is not there | `[]` | **`null`** |

  `readBytes` and `readLines` answered an empty array to both, so no caller could tell them
  apart — and the documentation said to ask `exists` first, which is a race dressed up as advice.
  `readText` was already `?string`; it is renamed only so the module has one word for one idea.

  The three old names still work, warn, and carry `until = "3.0"` — the compiler will stop the
  build on the day they are due, which is the mechanism 2.13 shipped for exactly this.

- **A native may return `?T[]`** (`RegisterOptionalArrayReturning`). Nothing about the VALUE
  needed building — an optional over a reference IS the reference — but the binder now checks
  three levels of type, because only the element below the optional and the array separates
  `?string[]` from `?uint8[]`. Without it a host could hand back bytes where the module expects
  lines, and the mistake would surface somewhere else entirely.

### The rule, written down

Two shapes, and each says what it is for:

- a **read** answers `?T` — `null` is "could not", an empty result is an empty file;
- an **operation** answers `bool` — whether it happened. It carries no value, so nothing is lost.

A predicate (`exists`, `isFile`, `isDirectory`) answers `bool` as well, and there `false` is an
answer rather than a failure.

**What none of them carries is a REASON**: a missing file and a permission denied look the same.
That gap is real and left open deliberately — carrying reasons means an error type and a decision
about `throws`, which is the larger question this release deliberately did not answer.

## v2.13.0 — 2026-08-22

The first link of the train that runs ahead of v3.0.0: everything that does not need a major
ships first, on its own, and deprecates what it replaces. This is the mechanism those
deprecations will be written with.

### Added

- **A deprecation may name the version that removes it.** `@Deprecated` carries a second field:

  ```lyr
  @Deprecated { message = "use renew", until = "3.5" }
  pub fn old(): int { return 1; }
  ```

  Building with a toolchain that has reached that version is an error (`LYR-SEM0081`), as is a
  version the compiler cannot read. A deprecation makes two promises — use something else, and
  this will disappear — and only the first was ever written where anyone could see it; the second
  lived in a release note, which is another way of saying it lived in somebody's memory.

  Three decisions in it, each of which could have gone the other way:

  - **The named version is the one that removes it.** `until = "3.5"` fails AT 3.5, not one
    release later, so the failure lands on whoever is preparing that release.
  - **The check sits at the declaration, not at a use.** A form kept past its date is wrong
    whether or not anything still calls it, and dead code would never trip a use-site warning.
  - **It stops the build rather than warning.** A warning about a removal that should already
    have happened is a warning nobody acts on — the same reasoning as the documentation ratchet
    and the corpus-silence invariant.

  Not a second attribute: an `@Sunset` beside `@Deprecated` would be a second mechanism for "this
  is going away", and the two would eventually disagree about a declaration carrying one and not
  the other. An empty `until` is the ordinary policy — warn now, remove at the next major.

## v2.12.0 — 2026-08-22

Bytecode format **3.6**. The interpreter runs the same programs in a third of the instructions,
and the release is about why that is the number that mattered.

### The measurement it started from

An instruction on this VM costs ~6 ns — and costs it **regardless of what it does**. A `br`, an
`add f64` and an `and i64` lie within twenty percent of each other. That is the normal price of a
switch-dispatch stack machine, not a slow interpreter: the dispatch is the whole bill. So nothing
that makes an instruction cheaper moves a program's time, and the only lever is executing fewer.

The loop test of every `while` in the language was four instructions, of which three existed to
move a value onto the operand stack and off it again.

### Added

- **Fused instructions** (format 3.6). Four opcodes that read local slots and write local slots,
  touching the operand stack not at all:

  | | |
  |---|---|
  | `brcmp`, `brcmpk` | compare two slots, or a slot and a constant, and branch |
  | `binll`, `binlk` | `dest = a op b` and `dest = a op k`, for any binary operation |

  A comparison in the arithmetic form writes a `bool`, exactly as the unfused pair leaves one on
  the stack; the destination may be one of the sources, which is what makes `i = i + 1` a single
  instruction. Instruction selection is in the emitter, not in the IR — a fused instruction is a
  property of the encoding, and the IR is the machine-independent form every pass reads.

  ```
  brcmpk lt i64 l0, 10000000 -> bb2, bb3
  binlk add f64 l1 = l1, 1.5
  binlk add i64 l0 = l0, 1
  br bb1
  ```

- **`std.random` draws in a native round.** Three shifts and three exclusive ors written in Lyric
  were 53 instructions, and on this VM a crossing into the host costs about what one instruction
  costs. The state stays in the script: one integer crosses, the next comes back. **The sequence
  is unchanged**, including the replaced zero seed, and it is pinned by a test now — the one
  beside it compared two generators with each other and would have held for any algorithm at all.

### Measured

Same harness, same machine, same session; the baseline is a build with selection switched off and
the old `nextInt`. Two iteration counts differenced, so nothing that happens once is in the
figure, and the instruction counts are read from an `ExecutionBudget` rather than counted by hand.

| case | instr | ns/iter | instr | ns/iter | |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| | *2.11* | *2.11* | *2.12* | *2.12* | |
| a counting loop | 9 | 44.3 | **3** | **18.2** | **2.4×** |
| an integer accumulator | 13 | 59.2 | **4** | **27.6** | **2.1×** |
| a float accumulator | 13 | 68.7 | **4** | **24.8** | **2.8×** |
| a masked accumulator | 15 | 88.7 | **9** | **61.2** | 1.4× |
| a native call | 14 | 82.4 | **8** | **56.9** | 1.4× |
| `Random.nextFloat()` | 70 | 395.4 | **42** | **199.2** | **2.0×** |
| an array read | 19 | 91.6 | **13** | **65.8** | 1.4× |

The time fell WITH the count rather than beside it, which is the claim the release rests on. What
rose is the average price per instruction (≈4.9 → ≈6.3 ns), and that is the healthy direction:
the instructions the fusion removed were the cheapest ones, the moves.

The rows that gain least say where the remaining work is: a nested expression keeps its
intermediate on the stack, and neither fused form can reach a value that is not in a slot.

### Format

**3.6 against 3.5**: four new opcodes. A producer may emit the unfused sequences instead, and one
that never emits a fused form writes a module any 3.5 runtime accepts; a module that uses one
needs a 3.6 runtime, named at load time.

The §Versioning rule was corrected in the same round. It read "a minor version may only add
skippable sections", which 3.4 was not — the note beside that version said as much, so the
document had contradicted itself since the day it shipped. It now states the compatibility the
format has actually delivered: per MODULE, not per version.

## v2.11.0 — 2026-08-22

Bytecode format **3.5**. One new section, and the whole release is about a name that used to get
lost.

### Added

- **A module records the `opaque type` a field was declared with** (section 14, format 3.5).
  An opaque alias is a distinct type in the language and its underlying type everywhere below the
  checker — that is what makes `x as Entity` free and lets a handle cross a native boundary
  unchanged. The cost showed up on the other side: a host reading the shape of an attributed
  class saw

  ```
  @Saved class Holder { hero: world.Entity, stage: int }   →   i64, i64
  ```

  and a save writer that WANTS to refuse a handle — the slot it names belongs to something else
  after a restart — had nothing to refuse it by. Now:

  ```csharp
  foreach (var field in module.Attributes.FieldsOf(saved.Target)!)
      if (field.OpaqueName is { } opaque)
          throw new InvalidOperationException($"{field.Name} is a '{opaque}' handle");
  ```

  `FieldsOf` returns `AttributeField` records instead of tuples; `Name` and `Type` are unchanged,
  `OpaqueName` is the addition and is `null` for every ordinary field. The name is the leaf
  through arrays and optionals — a field of type `Entity[]` answers `Entity`, and its type still
  says it is an array. A transparent alias resolves through to what it names, because that one is
  not a type of its own.

  **Nothing about the program changes.** The field is the same `i64` it was, no instruction moved,
  and a runtime that ignores the section is a runtime that knows what it knew before. `lyric
  disasm` shows the names where they exist: `names Holder(hero: Entity, stage)`.

### Format

- **3.5 against 3.4**: one new section, OpaqueFields (id 14), skippable in the plainest way — no
  other section refers to it and none of it affects execution. A 3.4 reader loads a 3.5 module
  unchanged, and the other way round; the only difference is whether a host can tell a handle
  from the number it is made of. Unlike 3.4, this one asks nothing of anybody.

## v2.10.1 — 2026-08-22

One fix, reported the day 2.10.0 landed: the new enum argument was unusable in the shape an SDK
actually writes.

### Fixed

- **An attribute's field default holds in every module that uses the attribute.** A default is
  written where the attribute is DECLARED — `layout: Layout = Layout.Shared` in the SDK — and read
  wherever someone writes `@Saved`. What a name in it MEANS is settled when its own declaration is
  checked, and declarations were checked in discovery order, so a use could be checked before the
  declaration it depends on. The result:

  | in another module | |
  |---|---|
  | `@Saved { layout = save.Layout.Separate }` | compiled |
  | `@Saved` | `LYR-SEM0069` |
  | `@Saved { version = 2 }` | `LYR-SEM0069` |

  The same code in a single file compiled, which is the tell. Declarations are checked in
  dependency order now — every module after the ones it imports — the same order globals have
  taken since 2.8, and for the same reason.

  It applies to both forms a default can name: an enum variant (2.10) and a `let` bound to a
  value (2.4).

## v2.10.0 — 2026-08-22

An attribute argument may name an enum variant. The bytecode format goes **3.3 → 3.4**, and this
is the first change to it that an older reader cannot ignore — see below.

### Added

- **A unit enum variant is an attribute argument.**

  ```lyr
  pub enum Layout { Packed, Separate }

  pub struct Saved :: [OnFunction] { layout: Layout = Layout.Packed }

  @Saved { layout = Layout.Separate }
  pub fn store(): void { }
  ```

  A vocabulary written as an enum is checked by the TYPE SYSTEM at the use site: `Layout.Seperate`
  is a compile error, where the same typo in a string is a row nobody ever matches — the fault
  class attributes closed for entry points, one field deeper. It works as a written argument, as a
  field default, and through a `let` bound to a variant, because one resolution walk answers all
  three.

  A variant **with a payload** is refused, and the message says why rather than repeating "must be
  a literal": a row holds one value per field, and a payload is values of its own.

  A host reads both halves — `Text` is the qualified variant (`Layout.Separate`), `AsInt` its tag.
  The disassembler prints the name too.

### Changed

- **Bytecode format 3.4**: `ConstValue` gains one form, an attribute value of enum type written as
  the variant's tag. The value names no enum — the field's type does, and the enum's entry names
  its variants, so the name is resolved rather than stored twice.

  **The compatibility note that matters**: the Attributes section is skippable as a whole, but a
  reader that does read it meets a tag it has no case for. A module whose attribute rows use an
  enum value therefore does **not** load on a runtime older than this one; a 3.4 module without
  such a value loads unchanged. That is the same forward path `co.next()` took in 2.2.0 — the
  module that uses the new thing is the module that needs the new runtime.

- **`LYR-SEM0066` says what it now allows**: a number, a string, a char, a bool, a unit enum
  variant, or a `let` bound to one.

## v2.9.0 — 2026-08-22

An editor can attach to a program a host is already running. The bytecode format stays **3.3** and
the language gains nothing.

### Added

- **`DapServer` serves a controller you already hold.** A second constructor takes a
  `DebugController` and the directory the scripts were compiled from; the client sends `attach`
  where it would otherwise send `launch`, and everything after that is the protocol as it was.
  Nothing is compiled, nothing is started — the program is running, which is the point. A game has
  no `main` to launch, and the bug worth stopping at is rarely the one at startup.

  One server per controller, which answers what a host with several scripts would otherwise have
  to invent: which program a `setBreakpoints` is about is decided by the connection it arrived on.
  The transport stays the host's business — the constructor takes two streams, so a socket, a pipe
  or anything else works without the adapter knowing about it. `lyrdbg` is unchanged: it launches,
  and an attaching adapter lives in the host's own process.

- **`DebugController.Detach()`** — gives the program back: breakpoints go, a parked thread is
  released, and the event stream ends. It is what a session needs when it ends without the program
  ending, and the attaching server calls it on `disconnect`. Without it a game whose editor
  crashed would stand at its breakpoint for good, and the breakpoints nobody reads any more would
  park it again on the next frame. A detached controller is spent; attaching again means a new
  one.

  A launched session is unaffected: there the process is the session, and ending it is the whole
  answer.

## v2.8.0 — 2026-08-22

Module constants initialize in dependency order, so a file compiles the same way whoever compiles
it. The bytecode format stays **3.3**; more programs compile than before and none fewer.

### Fixed

- **A module-level `let` may read one from a module it imports.** The order of initialization
  followed the order in which the entry file happened to discover the modules, so a THIRD module
  decided whether a SECOND one compiled:

  | the entry imports | `pub let doubled = a.width * 2;` in `b` |
  |---|---|
  | `a`, then `b` | compiled |
  | `b`, then `a` | `LYR-SEM0057` |
  | only `b`, which imports `a` itself | `LYR-SEM0057` |
  | `b` on its own | `LYR-SEM0057` |

  The import is the dependency statement, and the compiler had already followed it to load the
  file. Globals now initialize module by module in dependency order — every module after the ones
  it imports — and in declaration order within a module, which is the rule §4.3 of the
  specification now states.

  **Which file you compile no longer changes the answer.** That is the half that made this a
  defect rather than a wart: a host compiling every file as its own entry — to read its attribute
  rows before deciding what to load — saw errors `lyric check` never showed, and a project could
  look green for months and still refuse to start.

  Unchanged: the rule inside one module, where reading a constant declared further down is still
  `LYR-SEM0057`, and import cycles, which the resolver refuses as `LYR-RES0005` before the
  question arises. The diagnostic's message says what the order is now.

## v2.7.1 — 2026-08-22

One fix, to a request the debug adapter left unanswered.

### Fixed

- **`lyrdbg` answers `setExceptionBreakpoints`.** An editor configures exception breakpoints as
  part of its startup sequence — after the `initialized` event, before `configurationDone` —
  whether or not the adapter offers any filters to set. This one offers none and answered the
  request with an error, and a client that treats a failed configuration request as fatal never
  gets to `configurationDone`: the program stands there launched and never started, with no output
  and nothing to see.

  There is still nothing to set and nothing to report, so the answer carries no body. What changed
  is that it is an answer. Nothing about breakpoints, stepping or a running session behaves
  differently, and a client that never sends the request sees no change at all.

## v2.7.0 — 2026-08-21

One overload, and with it the debugger reaches the shape an embedded script actually has. The
bytecode format stays **3.3** and the language gains nothing.

### Added

- **`LoadedProgram.Invoke(index, debugController, args)`.** Since 2.3 the toolchain has had
  breakpoints, stepping, the call stack, locals and evaluate — offered at exactly one place,
  `RunEntry`, which starts a program at its `main`. A game has no `main`: its entry points are the
  functions a host calls once per frame through `Invoke`, so none of that machinery was reachable
  from a host. The budget got this shape in 2.4; the debugger gets it now.

  The call runs on the caller's thread and a breakpoint parks it, so the commands come from
  another one — the same arrangement `DebugController.Start` makes with the roles swapped. A
  controller survives across calls: its breakpoints hold for every invocation it is passed to, and
  a call into a function nothing breaks on returns without stopping. No `Exited` event arrives,
  because nothing ended — the host simply stopped calling — so the event stream stays open while
  the game runs.

  There is deliberately no overload taking a debugger and a budget together: a session parked at a
  breakpoint would spend a budget on standing still.

  What it does not do is keep a window drawing: the parked thread is the game's own. Drawing
  through a breakpoint needs an interpreter that can return to its host mid-instruction and resume
  later, and this one keeps its frame stack on the CLR stack. Guide 21 says so rather than leaving
  it to be discovered.

## v2.6.0 — 2026-08-21

A compilation error tells an embedding host WHERE it happened, and a panic hands over its
backtrace. Both were already known inside the toolchain and stopped at the boundary. The bytecode
format stays **3.3** and the language gains nothing.

### Added

- **`EmbeddingException.Diagnostics` carries file, line and column.** A compiler diagnostic holds
  a span, which is an index into the compilation's source manager plus offsets — and that manager
  belongs to the compilation, so a host caught a code and a message and nothing else. In a project
  of thirteen `.lyr` files that is the question "in which one?" every time, where the command line
  had been printing `src/held.lyr:129:15: error[LYR-SEM0002]: …` all along.

  The place is resolved at the throw, where the manager is still in hand. `File`, `Line` and
  `Column` stand on the diagnostic and on every note under it; `ToString()` gives the one-line form
  the command line prints. An error one import away carries THAT file's path — naming the entry
  file would be confidently wrong, which is worse than naming nothing.

- **`ScriptPanicException.Backtrace`** — the Lyric call stack, innermost first, each frame naming
  its line while the module carries a source map. The frames existed; reaching them meant naming
  `LyricPanic`, a type of the runtime assembly this API exists so a host need not reference.

### Changed

- **The element type of `EmbeddingException.Diagnostics` is now `ScriptDiagnostic`** rather than
  the compiler's `Diagnostic`. `Code`, `Severity` and `Message` keep their names, so host code
  reading those compiles unchanged; what goes is `Span`, which no host could resolve — the very
  reason for this release.

## v2.5.1 — 2026-08-21

One fix, to a promise the formatter's own chapter makes.

### Fixed

- **`lyric fmt` breaks operator chains at the 100-column limit.** A condition of three
  comparisons ran to 140 characters and stayed there, idempotently: `BinaryDoc` held no line
  opportunity at all, so a chain could not break however long it grew. The limit is documented as
  the tool's contract, and it now holds for expressions too.

  A chain that does not fit breaks before **every** operator of its precedence level, indented
  one step — the operator leads its line, as PEP 8, rustfmt and the .NET style default all
  settled on. The level breaks as a unit: `a && b && c` is one decision, so no staircase of
  nested pairs. A tighter level inside stays flat while the looser one breaks.

  One shape is deliberately left alone: a chain with an operand that breaks by itself — a `match`
  or `if` expression, a lambda with a block — stays as it is, because a group around it could
  never be flat and the chain would break for a reason that has nothing to do with the width.

  **Formatted files can change shape**: a `lyric fmt --check` in CI may report files that were
  clean before. Nothing in this repository's own corpus changed, which is how narrow the
  reformatting turned out to be.

## v2.5.0 — 2026-08-21

One requirement from the embedder, and the documentation gap beside it. The bytecode format stays
**3.3**; nothing on the wire changes, which is the whole finding.

### Fixed

- **A native signature may name a value struct of ANOTHER SDK module.** An SDK of several files
  declares its `Vec2` once; before this only the declaring module could name it, so a second
  module (`engine.camera.toWorld(x, y): world.Vec2`) was `LYR-IR0001` — "non-primitive type in a
  declared signature" — whether the type was imported selectively or written module-qualified.
  Both forms work now, as parameter and as return.

  It is the same shape as the imported-alias fix of 2.2.1, one function away in the same file:
  the lookup was module-local and never asked the resolver. The 2.2.1 note called the restriction
  "documented and deliberate" — that was too generous. Its reason (an alias has nothing to
  flatten) explains why the alias fix did not carry structs along; it does not explain why a
  foreign struct may not be flattened, and there is no such reason. What crosses the wire is a
  LAYOUT, a layout belongs to the program rather than to the file that wrote it down, and the
  host is held to it by the same load-time check as before.

  Unchanged: a struct in a native signature flattens to scalars and strings, so a field that is
  an array or an object is still refused — crossing a module line changes nothing about what the
  host would have to know.

### Documentation

- **The `…Int` family of `std.math` is named in the guide.** `clamp` takes floats and `clampInt`
  takes ints, as `min`/`minInt` and `abs`/`absInt` do, because the language has no overloading and
  the library distinguishes by the type in the name. Reaching for `clamp` with three `int`s and
  getting `cannot assign 'int' to 'float'` is the convention working as designed — but chapter 13
  never said so where someone would look for it.

## v2.4.0 — 2026-08-21

M31: two additive answers to what an embedder found in production. A host can bound how long
foreign code runs, and an attribute argument may name its value instead of repeating it. The
bytecode format stays **3.3**, and a module compiled by 2.3 loads unchanged. Two conformance
cases activate with this release (`//! since: 2.4.0`); the suite stands at 90.

### Added

- **An instruction budget for embedded code.** `new ExecutionBudget(2_000_000)`, handed to
  `Instantiate` or to a call, stops a script that will not stop by itself:

  ```csharp
  try { instance.CallVoid("onUpdate", budget, 0.016); }
  catch (ScriptBudgetException) { mods.Disable(instance); }
  ```

  A capability decides what a script may REACH; `while (true) { }` needs none, and until now
  nothing bounded it. The budget counts **instructions, not milliseconds**, so the same script
  under the same limit stops at the same instruction on every machine — a wall clock cannot
  promise that, and a replay needs it. `Consumed` after a call that fits is how a host arrives
  at a number worth setting; `Reset()` refills; one budget passed to several calls bounds a
  whole frame across several scripts, and a host function calling back in draws from the same
  one.

  `Instantiate` takes one because the constant initializer runs there — a module-level
  `let x = spin();` used to hang the load itself, before the host had called anything.

  The stop is `LYR-CAP0002` and arrives as a **panic**: the script cannot catch it and no
  `defer` runs behind it, which is what makes it worth having against code you do not trust.
  `ScriptBudgetException` derives from `ScriptPanicException`, so a host written before this
  keeps catching what it caught — the separate type is there to tell "this script is broken"
  from "this script was still working". What it does NOT bound is host time: a native of yours
  that blocks for a second is charged one instruction.

- **An attribute argument may name its value.** Beside a literal, an argument may be a `let`
  whose initializer is one — through a chain of them, across modules, imported selectively or
  written module-qualified, and a `static let` on a type the same way:

  ```lyr
  pub let CLEARED = "tetris.cleared";

  @On { event = CLEARED }
  pub fn onCleared(): void { }
  ```

  This is what lets a program publish a vocabulary — event names, kinds, versions — and have
  its consumers checked. Repeating the raw string was the last place where a typo produced a
  handler nobody ever calls, which is the fault class attributes closed for entry points.

  It is **not** constant folding: `let LIMIT = 1 + 2;` stays rejected, because the value has to
  stand in the source and this language folds nothing anywhere. One edge worth knowing: the
  named form is slightly stricter than the written one, since `@A { n = 5 }` adapts the literal
  to a narrow field while `let N = 5;` is already an `int` — a narrow field wants
  `let N: int32 = 5;`.

## v2.3.1 — 2026-08-21

The post-2.3.0 audit's patch wave: four measured bugs, none of them reachable from a program
that was doing anything unusual. The bytecode format stays **3.3**, and the language gains
nothing — three of the four were valid programs the toolchain mishandled. Three conformance
cases activate with this release (`//! since: 2.3.1`); the suite stands at 88.

### Fixed

- **A parent interface's default method works through a child-typed value.** `c.describe()`,
  where `describe` is a default declared on the parent of `c`'s interface, was an internal
  compiler error in Debug and a wrong receiver slot in Release — the optimizer had resolved
  the slot to the parent's function and called it directly with a child-typed value, which the
  language does not convert either. All three routes to such a default are fixed and pinned:
  through an interface-typed value, through a constraint naming the child, and through an
  element of an interface-typed array. The constraint route had a second gap of its own and
  reported "'C' has no 'describe'" from the lowering.
- **An array literal gives its elements the element type.** `let xs: (?int)[] = [null, 5];`
  was accepted by the checker and refused by the lowering ("'null' in a position without an
  expected type"), and `let xs: Shape[] = [Sq { }];` put class references where interface
  values were declared — an internal error in Debug, a wrong dispatch in Release. An element
  is a context position like every other now.
- **A redirected stream carries UTF-8.** On Windows the console's code page encoded redirected
  output too, and `lyrrepl` set that shared code page unconditionally — so a tool running
  beside a REPL could have its output best-fit-mapped, turning an em dash into a hyphen. Every
  tool now writes UTF-8 into a redirected stream and reads UTF-8 from a redirected stdin; the
  code page is set only for a console that really is one. This is what made individual
  process-spawning tests fail sporadically under load since M16.
- **A float renders with a lowercase exponent.** `println(f"{1.0e21}")` wrote `1E+21`, where
  C, Go, Python, JavaScript and Rust all write `1e+21`. `std.string.fromFloat` backs the
  f-string lowering, so its output is program behaviour: the shape is now specified (spec §11)
  and pinned — shortest round-trip, plain decimal while the decimal exponent lies in `-4 .. 16`
  and scientific outside it, `Infinity` / `-Infinity` / `NaN`, `-0` for negative zero. The
  disassembler, the IR printer and the debugger's variables panel render through the same one
  place.

## v2.3.0 — 2026-08-20

M30: the toolchain learns to debug. Breakpoints, stepping, the call stack and the variables
panel, in any editor that speaks the Debug Adapter Protocol — the VS Code extension wires it to
F5. The bytecode format goes **3.2 → 3.3**; the change is one strippable section, so a 3.2
runtime loads a 3.3 module unchanged, and every 2.x module keeps loading here.

### Added

- **`lyrdbg`, the debug adapter — the eleventh binary.** An editor launches it over stdio. It
  compiles the program itself, in the debug shape — source map, debug info, optimizations OFF,
  because an inlined callee has no frame to show — so what you debug is always the file in the
  editor; a prebuilt `.lyrbc` launches as it is. Breakpoints stop before the line runs, slide
  from a blank line to the next mapped one, and hit on every loop pass; stepping is
  line-granular with the standard over/in/out rules; a pause lands before the next instruction.
  The panels show the real frame stack with source lines, the locals of any frame, a Globals
  scope, and structured values expanded — struct and class fields by name, enum variants with
  their payload, arrays by index, interface values as their concrete type. Hover and the debug
  console evaluate dotted name paths (`player.pos.x`); expressions are out by design — half an
  expression compiler answers wrongly. The program's own stdout/stderr arrive as labeled output
  events; a panic ends the session with its message, backtrace and exit code 101.
- **Bytecode format 3.3: the DebugInfo section (id 13).** The names of local and global slots,
  strippable like the source map, written by default; a compiler-created slot carries the empty
  string and is never shown. The Names section (id 12) becomes a floor instead of a ceiling:
  with debug info on it carries field names for ANY named type, so a debugger can expand an
  object. `lyrc build --no-debug-info` strips both back to the 3.2 shape; `lyrvm info` reports
  `source map` and `debug info` presence.
- **`CompilerOptions.DebugInfo` and `CompilerOptions.Optimize`** in the frontend library: the
  debug shape is available to any host that compiles.
- **Guide chapter 21 — Debugging**, including the three stated limits: the global initializer
  runs before the debugger attaches, standard-library lines are not steppable, and optimized
  bytecode shows the optimizer's world.

### Fixed

- **`tools/Bench` compiles again.** The 2.0 deprecation removal took `std.collections.emptySet`
  with it and the harness's `set_iter` case was never migrated; every run died before the first
  number. The case uses `Set<int>.empty()` now, and a case that fails to compile names itself
  and its diagnostics.

## v2.2.1 — 2026-08-20

One fix, found by the embedder the same day: the specification's §3.5 promises that an opaque
alias resolves to its underlying in a native signature — without restricting where the alias
was declared. The toolchain under-delivered.

### Fixed

- **An imported opaque type resolves in a native signature.** An SDK of several modules
  declares its handle type once (`engine.world` owns `TextureId`) and names it in a sibling's
  natives (`engine.assets`: `pub fn load(name: string): TextureId;`) — that was `LYR-IR0001`
  ("non-primitive type in a declared signature") while the same alias resolved fine in the
  declaring module and in every ordinary signature. Both import forms work now, selective and
  module-qualified, in scalar and array positions; transparent aliases resolve the same way.
  Value structs stay module-local in native signatures — that restriction is documented and
  deliberate, an alias has nothing to flatten.

## v2.2.0 — 2026-08-20

The A8 wave: both coroutine edges Erato's register filed after building its cutscene driver,
plus one the fix uncovered. The bytecode format stays **3.2**; a module that never calls
`next()` loads on every 2.x runtime. Four conformance cases activate with this release
(`//! since: 2.2.0`); the suite stands at 85.

### Added

- **`co.next()` — the safe pull.** It advances a coroutine exactly like `resume` and answers
  `?T`: the value, or `null` once the body has run to its end — and `null` stays the answer on
  every further call, where `resume` keeps its promised panic. A `Coroutine<void>` answers
  `bool` (did it advance?), so `while (p.next()) { }` drives it out; a `Coroutine<?T>` refuses
  the form (`LYR-SEM0080`) because `null` would mean two things there — drive it with `resume`
  and a protocol of your own. The name and shape are `Iterator<T>.next()`'s on purpose.

  A query that does NOT pull (`isDone`) was probed and rejected: a pull-based coroutine cannot
  know whether another value comes without running the body, which is why no generator API in
  Python, JavaScript or C# has one. The pull with an end signal is the honest form.

  On the wire, exhaustion is read back through the compiler-bound native
  `std.core.coroutineIsDone`; an older runtime rejects a module that uses `next()` at load time
  with that name in the message — the format's designed forward path.

### Fixed

- **`Coroutine<T>` works as a field type.** A class or struct field, and a type argument
  (`List<Coroutine<T>>`), used to be refused with `LYR-IR0001` ("type 'Coroutine' (not a
  class)") while the same type worked as a parameter and a local. A driver now holds its
  coroutines directly instead of hiding each behind a captured closure.
- **A bare `return;` in the middle of a coroutine body works.** It compiled to a valueless
  return from a value-yielding body — an internal compiler error in Debug, malformed bytecode in
  Release, and the coroutine was never marked exhausted. It is now exactly the run-through exit:
  the next `resume` panics, the next `next()` answers `null`. (`return;` in tail position, the
  common form, was always fine.)

## v2.1.1 — 2026-08-20

One fix, found the day of 2.1.0 by the first embedder to re-pin: a compiler crash on a form
the language always meant to allow.

### Fixed

- **A static call through a module-qualified type works.** `import std.random;` followed by
  `random.Random.seeded(1234)` crashed the compiler with an internal error out of the lowering
  ("type not lowerable") — the qualified type name got an unreported error type instead of a
  diagnostic. The form now compiles and dispatches exactly like `Random.seeded(1234)` after a
  selective import; a qualified type name standing alone in value position reports
  `LYR-SEM0052`, and a qualified generic without type arguments reports `LYR-SEM0063`, both as
  the bare name always has.

## v2.1.0 — 2026-08-20

The ergonomics wave: two additive changes the audit measured the edges of. Four conformance
cases activate with this release (`//! since: 2.1.0`); one 2.0 case pinning the old
non-context rule retires with its sentence.

### Added

- **`@Deprecated` reaches members.** A method, field or `static let` of a struct, class or
  enum — and an extend method — may carry `@Deprecated`; every use warns at the use site,
  exactly like a deprecated free function. Only this one attribute is admitted there: the
  module format has no member rows, and `@Deprecated` is the attribute that needs none.
  Interface members stay attribute-free — deprecating an abstract member would raise
  conformance questions nobody has answered.
- **The adaptation context propagates structurally.** `let xs: int64[] = [1, 2, 3];`,
  `let i: int64 = if (c) 4 else 5;` and the match twin compile now: in a §3.1 context the
  array elements and the arms check against the context type, an unsuffixed literal adapts,
  and a misfit errors at the element or arm. Without a context, elements and arms unify among
  themselves as before. Parameter defaults thread their context too.

## v2.0.1 — 2026-08-20

The first harvest of the deep audit: seven bugs measured against the now-normative
specification, fixed as one wave. Seven new conformance cases activate with this release
(`//! since: 2.0.1`); the suite stands at 78.

### Fixed

- **`a..=hi` reaches the type's maximum.** The inclusive range desugared to `..hi+1`, which
  wraps at the bound — `for (_ in max-2..=max)` ran ZERO times. Inclusive ranges ride their
  own adapter with a done flag now; no arithmetic touches the bound.
- **Ranges over every width and signedness.** A range over `uint8`/`int16`/… produced
  malformed IR that only the Release verifier-skip let run; a `uint` range crossing 2⁶³
  compared SIGNED and ran dry. Bounds now widen into a signed or unsigned carrier, and the
  loop variable converts back at its own width.
- **`defer` belongs to the block.** A defer in a loop body registered once into the function
  scope: it fired once, with the last iteration's values, after the code following the loop.
  Loop bodies are scopes now — the defer runs at every iteration's end, `continue` and
  `break` included, draining exactly the scopes being left.
- **`let x = null;` and `let xs = [];` report instead of crashing.** Both drove an unhandled
  internal exception through the lowering. They are `LYR-SEM0010` now: the initializer fixes
  no type, the binding needs an annotation.
- **An oversized literal no longer reinterprets.** `let x = 9223372036854775808;` compiled
  and held −9223372036854775808 — the magnitude's raw bits. A literal that stays at the
  default `int` must fit `int`; the same magnitude still adapts to annotated `uint`
  positions.
- **An integer literal meets a float exactly.** `let g: float = 9007199254740993;` (2⁵³+1)
  adapted with a silent rounding; "fits" is exact now, for `float` and `float32` alike.
- **A `throws` clause on `main` is refused** (`LYR-SEM0021`). It compiled, and a thrown
  exception left the program as the `LYR-VM0010` panic the specification calls unreachable
  from source.

### Improved

- "cannot assign 'T' to 'T'" names its cause: when the two displays collide, the message says
  the types differ by identity — declared in different scopes, or a generic call
  instantiating itself at a larger type, which monomorphization refuses.
- A contextless generic construction reports `LYR-SEM0026` once, without a follow-up
  "cannot assign" per field.
- A new test pins the §11 contract: every native the shipped stdlib declares is bound by the
  default registry (`std.build` excepted — the build runner is its host, now said in §11).

## v2.0.0 — 2026-08-20

The specification is **normative** from this release on: `lyriclang/lyric-spec` defines the
language, the toolchain implements it, and a divergence is a toolchain bug. The major cuts the
SOURCE surface — everything the 1.x deprecation clocks announced — while the bytecode format
stays **3.2** and bytecode compiled against 1.x keeps loading.

### Removed — the 2.0 cut

Everything `@Deprecated` announced through 1.x is gone from the source surface. The registry
still binds the old NATIVE names, so bytecode compiled against 1.x keeps loading; what the cut
takes is the ability to write the old forms in new code.

- **The free string forms** (`length(s)`, `trim(s)`, `toUpper(s)`, … — 27 declarations): the
  method API (`s.length()`, v1.15) is the one form. `concat` and `repeat` stay free — they
  back `+` and `*` — and the `fromXxx`/`parseXxx` families keep their names.
- **The free constructors** `emptyList`, `emptyMap`, `emptySet`, `newStringBuilder`:
  constructors live on the types (`List<T>.empty()`, `StringBuilder.new()`, v1.12).
- **`std.math.Random` and `newRandom`**: randomness lives in `std.random` (v1.14).
- **`write`/`writeln`**: `print`/`println` take any `Display` value (v1.14).
- **`StringBuilder.length()`**: it counted appended PIECES, an implementation detail; measure
  the built string. (It never carried `@Deprecated` — an attribute cannot sit on a member —
  its doc announced the 2.0 removal instead.)

### Changed

- **`Hashable<T>` declares `Equatable<T>` as its parent.** A hash table cannot exist without
  equality; demanding the hash without the comparison was a lie by omission. A key constraint
  is `K :: [Hashable<K>]` alone — `Map`, `Set` and their helpers dropped the second
  constraint. A type conforming to `Hashable` now implements `hash` AND `equals`.
- **`LYR-SEM0074` is an error.** Calling a static extension method through an instance was a
  warning through 1.x with the message announcing this change; the clock has run out. The one
  1.x→2.0 severity change, recorded as such in the specification (§12.1).
- **`docs/Grammar.md` and `docs/Bytecode.md` are checked mirrors.** The canonical home of both
  is `lyriclang/lyric-spec` (chapters 02 and 13); CI diffs the copies here against the
  specification, so drift fails the build.
- **A library prunes from its `pub` surface.** A compile without an entry point takes the
  `pub` functions of the compiled modules as reachability roots — a library's surface decides
  its contents, and the standard library no longer ships whole inside every library or
  embedded script. Observable at the host boundary: a private function nothing public reaches
  is not in the module (`Defines` says so), which is why this waited for the major.

## v1.16.0 — 2026-08-19

The language has a specification: `lyriclang/lyric-spec` holds twelve chapters and a
conformance suite, non-normative until 2.0 — and from this release on the semantics are
FROZEN. Two toolchain fixes came out of writing it. The bytecode format stays **3.2**.

### Fixed

- **`{{` and `}}` in f-strings produce a literal brace** — promised by the grammar since 1.0,
  honored by the lexer since this release: `f"json: {{\"k\": {n}}}"` renders braces instead
  of a parse error. A lone `}` in the text stays ordinary text. Found by the spec audit.

- **`catch (e: Throwable)` catches now.** It compiled — the exception analysis treats an
  interface catch as handling — and then never caught: the handler carried the interface's
  type id and the runtime compared it against the thrown CLASS, so the exception flew past a
  clause the compiler had accepted. Found by the conformance suite on its first run. The
  explicit `Throwable` catch is the catch-all now, identical to `catch (e)`; a catch naming
  any OTHER interface is refused with a diagnostic until the handler table can express a
  conformance test — the alternative was a clause that silently caught nothing.

## v1.15.0 — 2026-08-19

The freeze prep: the design leftovers settled before the spec freezes semantics. `opaque type`
arrives, the string API becomes methods, iterator chaining gets its documented No — and a
latent function-id collision in the lowering falls. The bytecode format stays **3.2**.

### Fixed

- **A function-id collision in the lowering**, latent since struct-returning natives: the
  global initializer's slot was reserved only for DECLARED globals, but a struct-return buffer
  CREATES one during body lowering — and once a body also requested an extension method (the
  new string methods do), initializer and extension landed on the same id, and calls
  mis-spliced into the wrong function. The initializer draws from the shared id counter now,
  and the function list refuses id holes with a named internal error instead of a silent
  mis-splice.

### Added

- **Strings have methods**: `s.trim()`, `s.split(",")`, `s.contains(x)`, `s.length()` — 26
  methods via `extend string` in `std.string`. The free forms warn as **deprecated** and go
  with 2.0; `concat` and `repeat` stay free (they back `+` and `*`), and the type-directed
  families (`fromXxx`, `parseXxx`) keep their names. The methods come with any import of the
  module; a file needing no free name writes `import std.string as strings;` — and an import
  whose extensions are used no longer counts as unused. `s.length()` stays a call because it
  costs O(n), and every method returns a NEW string.

- **`opaque type`**: an alias with a new IDENTITY over the same layout —
  `pub opaque type Entity = int;`. Nothing converts implicitly in either direction; the explicit
  `as` to exactly the underlying and back is the one crossing; `==`/`!=` compare within one
  alias; arithmetic, ordering, constraint satisfaction and f-string rendering are refused. At
  runtime the value IS its underlying (the cast costs nothing), and a native signature resolves
  the alias to the underlying — an SDK's handle crosses the host boundary as a plain number
  while scripts can neither forge one nor leak it. Neither `opaque` nor `type` is a keyword;
  both stay usable as identifiers.

## v1.14.0 — 2026-08-19

The std polish, born from a line-by-line audit. The string module stops being quadratic, the
print family collapses to one generic concept, the collections learn the operations daily use
kept reaching for, arrays cross the native boundary as parameters for the first time — and two
new modules arrive: `std.random` and `std.time`. The bytecode format stays **3.2**.

### Added

- **`print`, `println`, `eprint` and `eprintln` take any `Display` value**: `println(42)`,
  `println(true)`. The string forms keep working unchanged — a string displays as itself — and
  `write`/`writeln` warn as **deprecated**; they were the same thing under a second name.
  Bytecode compiled before this release keeps running.

- **Collections round out**: `List` gains `insert`, `removeAt`, `first`, `last`, `reverse` and
  `swap`; `Map` gains `getOr`, `clear` and `entries` — key and value in ONE walk, without the
  second probe per key; `Set` gains `clear` and is `Iterable`, so `for (v in set)` walks it
  directly. `clear` on all three keeps the backing for reuse; the values are released all the
  same.

- **`std.iter` gains `flatMap`, `chunks`, `reduce` and `first`.**

- **Arrays cross the native boundary as parameters** — the bytecode format always allowed it
  (§3 type grammar; format stays **3.2**), the registry just never used it. On top of it:
  `std.io.file.writeBytes` and `appendBytes` (the write side readBytes was waiting for),
  `std.string.utf8Encode` and `utf8Decode` — the strict bridge: invalid bytes answer `null`
  instead of the U+FFFD replacement `readText` documents — and `fromChars` became one native
  call instead of one string per character.

- **`std.random`**: the generator moved out of `std.math` — randomness is not arithmetic —
  and gained what it was missing there: `shuffle` (Fisher–Yates over a `List`), `choice` and
  `nextGaussian`. Deterministic, seeded by the caller, no capability. The `std.math.Random`
  twin stays one release as a deprecated migration path.

- **`std.time`**: `Instant` and `Duration` as value structs over epoch milliseconds —
  `b.since(a)`, `a.plus(d)`, and `iso()` rendering UTC ISO 8601 with floor semantics, so an
  instant before 1970 lands in the right day. Gated by `osAccess`, the same bit as `std.os`:
  reading the clock is a question to the environment, and a new bit would be a contract change.
  The subtraction is a named method, not an operator — `Instant - Instant` yields a Duration,
  and the operator interfaces are homogeneous by the v1.13 decision.

### Fixed

- **`std.string` stops being quadratic.** `StringBuilder.build` and `join` folded left and
  copied the whole result once per piece — both are one native join now; `replace` moves
  untouched stretches as whole substrings; the searches, parsers and trims index a character
  array instead of calling O(n) `charAt` per position. Same results, different cost curve.

- Audit rests: `std.fmt` loses its German locals, `std.io.file` a torn doc fragment, and
  `std.io.console` sorts a native above the "written in Lyric" divider it contradicted.

## v1.13.0 — 2026-08-19

The language gaps close. Interface inheritance arrives — one parent, implied through the whole
chain — compound assignment reaches through the operator interfaces, block lambdas infer their
return type, and `std.core` becomes the import-free root of the library. One question got its
documented No: heterogeneous operator arithmetic. The bytecode format stays **3.2**.

### Added

- **Interface inheritance**: an interface may declare one parent — `interface Labeled :: [Named]`.
  Conforming to the child implies conforming to the whole chain: implementing types provide the
  chain's abstract members (a missing one names the implying interface), inherit its default
  methods, satisfy parent constraints, and carry into parent-typed interface values. A value of
  the child's interface type answers the parent's members too. The rules: at most one parent
  (several requirements side by side are constraints: `<T :: [A, B]>`), only interfaces, no
  cycles (`LYR-SEM0078`), and no redeclaring a chain member (`LYR-SEM0079`) — an inherited
  member keeps its declaring interface, so the same call cannot dispatch two ways. What a chain
  does NOT add: a child interface *value* does not convert to the parent's type — conformance is
  implied for the implementing type; take the concrete value through the parent directly.
  `std.core` does not adopt `Hashable :: [Equatable]` yet: changing what every conforming type
  must implement is a breaking cut reserved for 2.0.

- **Compound assignment reaches through the operator interfaces**: `v += w` on a type conforming
  to `Add<T>` now compiles for variable targets (locals, captured variables) instead of
  reporting `LYR-SEM0003`. Field and element targets stay written out — the desugaring would
  evaluate the object or the index twice, and that stays visible in source.

- **Block lambdas infer their return type**: `(x: int) => { return x * 2; }` needs neither an
  annotation nor a context anymore — the type comes from the body's `return` statements,
  unified like match arms (`return null;` widens to the optional). This also closes the
  open-generic case: `apply(5, (n) => { … })` binds `U` from the block. A non-void inferred
  lambda still needs return coverage, and disagreeing returns are one error at the lambda.

### Changed

- **`LYR-PAR0039` retired**: `interface B :: [A]` parses since this release; everything the
  parent list may not be is a semantic message now, not a parse error.

- **`newStringBuilder` warns as deprecated** — the piece v1.12 had to leave out. `std.core`
  imports nothing anymore: its extensions use private duplicates of six string natives
  (`fromInt` through `charAt`; the registry binds both names to the same host function), which
  makes `std.core` the library's root — and `import std.core { Deprecated }` inside
  `std.string` legal. Public API is unchanged; existing bytecode keeps running.

### Fixed

- **`@Deprecated` keeps its promise**: it emits no metadata row and roots nothing. Previously a
  non-generic deprecated function survived dead-code pruning in every importing program — dead
  code carried along exactly because it was marked for removal.

## v1.12.0 — 2026-08-19

The standard library grows up. Every public item is documented, constructors live on the types,
the first real deprecations start their clock, and the library tests itself — in Lyric. Two
compiler fixes came out of the work. The bytecode format stays **3.2**.

### Added

- **Constructors on the types**: `List<T>.empty()`, `Map<K, V>.empty()`, `Set<T>.empty()`,
  `StringBuilder.new()` and `Random.seeded(seed)`. The free functions `emptyList`, `emptyMap`,
  `emptySet` and `newRandom` still work and warn as **deprecated** — the first real uses of
  `@Deprecated`, and their removal lands with the next major. (`newStringBuilder` points at its
  successor in the documentation; its attribute waits on `std.core` visibility inside
  `std.string`, where the import would be a cycle.)

- **`std.io.file.readBytes`**: the whole content as raw bytes, undecoded — the answer
  `readText` cannot give, because its UTF-8 decoding turns invalid bytes into U+FFFD. Writing
  bytes is not there yet: an array has never crossed the native boundary as a parameter, and
  that machinery is a change of its own.

- **The standard library tests itself.** `stdlib-tests/` holds behavioral tests written in
  Lyric and run by `lyric test`; the build runs them, and both repository invariants —
  formatted, and compiling in silence — cover the directory.

- **Every public item of the standard library is documented** — hover and the reference site
  answer everywhere — and a test pins completeness, not a count: new API without documentation
  is a red build.

- **A bare import that shadows a builtin type warns** (`LYR-SEM0077`): `import std.string;`
  binds the name `string`, and the annotation then names the module. The warning says the way
  out; using the shadowed name as a type is now a proper error naming the trap — previously it
  CRASHED the compiler on the local-annotation path.

### Changed

- **`@Deprecated` may sit on generic declarations** — the one exception to the
  no-attributes-on-generics rule, because its consumer is the compiler and no metadata row is
  involved; none is emitted there.

- **A static call on a generic instance substitutes the caller's type parameter**:
  `List<T>.empty()` inside your own generic function works now; previously the lowering met the
  bare `T` and failed with an internal error.

- Two parameters of `std.string.replace`/`replaceFirst` are named `replacement` (signature help
  used to show a German name); every remaining German local and section header in the library
  is English now.

## v1.11.0 — 2026-08-19

Attributes stop being decoration. One is now read by the compiler — `@Deprecated` — and one by
a new tool: `lyric test` runs every function marked `@Test`. The bytecode format stays **3.2**,
and no existing program changes meaning.

### Added

- **`@Deprecated`, the first attribute the compiler reads.** From `std.core`, on a function, a
  type or a module: every use warns (`LYR-SEM0076`) at the use site, the note points at the
  attribute, and `message` says what to use instead. Resolved by IDENTITY — a struct someone
  else names `Deprecated` deprecates nothing. Uses inside anything itself deprecated are exempt,
  so a deprecated function may keep calling its deprecated siblings; a deprecated module warns
  at the imports that pull it in. It changes diagnostics and nothing else — the same module
  compiles either way. Editors strike deprecated uses through.

  With this the compiler-read attribute set becomes part of the language contract: `@Deprecated`
  is in it, everything else stays inert.

- **`lyric test` — tests, the Go shape.** Tests live under `tests/` (or the `testRoot` your
  `lyric.json` names) and only the test runner ever compiles them; production builds never see
  a test file. A test is a top-level function marked `@Test` from the new **`std.test`**, fails
  by panicking, and runs in a **fresh instance** — module state cannot leak between tests.

  ```bash
  lyric test
  ```

  `std.test` ships the marker and the assertions: `assertTrue`, and `assertEq` over
  `[Equatable<T>, Display]`, naming both values when they differ. The report is plain text, one
  line per test; the exit code is `0` when everything passed and `1` otherwise. No `tests/`
  directory means no tests and exits 0; a testRoot named explicitly and missing is an error.
  Guide chapter 20 covers it.

  The runner is `lyrtest`, the tenth binary, and it drives the compiled module through the
  embedding API — the attribute rows for discovery, a call handle per test: the same machinery
  a host uses, now with a consumer that is not a test of it.

- **`HostOptions.SourceRoot`** in the embedding API: a host may compile a file whose imports
  resolve against a directory other than the file's own — the test runner compiling `tests/`
  against `src/` is the case that added it.

### Not in this release

- **Test filters, parallel execution, expectPanic, fixtures and setup/teardown, JSON output,
  editor test integration** — deliberately; each is an idea issue, none blocks running tests.
- **Suppressing a deprecation warning in code**: the mechanism would be another compiler-read
  attribute, and the set grows by decision. `--deny-warnings` still means what it says.

## v1.10.0 — 2026-08-19

The compiler learns to speak below "error". Four severities, warnings that matter, notes that
point at places, and a CI gate. The language, the bytecode format (**3.2**) and the embedding
API are unchanged; every program that compiled still compiles — some now hear about themselves.

### Added

- **Warnings.** A local binding, loop variable, catch binding or pattern binding that is never
  referenced (`LYR-SEM0071` — naming it `_` is the opt-out; parameters and the shorthand field
  pattern `Rect { w, h }` are deliberately exempt). An imported name nobody in the file uses
  (`LYR-SEM0072`). A statement control flow can never reach (`LYR-SEM0073`). And a static
  extension method called through an instance (`LYR-SEM0074`): that form is **deprecated** and
  becomes an error in the next major — the warning is the clock. Warnings stay silent over a
  program with errors, and never fail a build by themselves.

- **`--deny-warnings`** on `check` and `build`, for CI: the warnings keep their severity in the
  output, one closing error (`LYR-CLI0016`) carries the policy into the exit code, and a denied
  build writes no artifact. The `lyric.json` unknown-key warnings are real diagnostics now
  (`LYR-CLI0017`) and count toward the gate.

- **Notes on diagnostics.** A duplicate declaration points back at the first one, a missing
  interface method points at the member it fails (in whatever file it lives), an unknown name
  suggests the single closest candidate in scope, and an unknown member suggests from the same
  list completion offers. Rendered indented under the caret block in text — deliberately not in
  the head-line format a problem matcher reads — as a `notes` array in `--json` (only when
  present, so existing consumers read what they always read), and as related information in
  editors.

- **The first hint.** `LYR-SEM0075`: a `var` through which nothing is ever changed — no
  reassignment, no field or element write, no `mut` call, not handed over by reference — could
  be a `let`. A `var` that documents mutation keeps its `var`.

- **An error that was silent misbehavior**: two files claiming one module name is `LYR-RES0007`
  with a note at the first claim, instead of a shadow registration nothing could explain.

- **Editors draw the difference**: unused and unreachable code fades, the deprecated instance
  form is struck through, and every note is a click away. The severity `info` exists on the
  wire for what later versions will say at it.

- **Guide chapter 19** documents the contract: severities, codes as stable identifiers, the
  gate, and what warns today. The repository holds itself to it — the standard library, the
  examples and the templates check in silence, and a test keeps them there.

### Changed

- **The editor clients live in their own repositories** ([vscode-lyric](https://github.com/lyriclang/vscode-lyric),
  [jetbrains-lyric](https://github.com/lyriclang/jetbrains-lyric)) and release their
  installables there, on their own cadence. Toolchain releases v1.8.0 through v1.9.1 carried
  them beside the archives; from this release on they are found there. The project moved to the
  `lyriclang` organization.

- Two messages stopped promising futures: the duplicate-function hint lost its "in v1"
  (overloading was rejected for good in v1.5.0), and the block-lambda limit `LYR-SEM0046` now
  states the problem in the message and its way out in a note.

## v1.9.1 — 2026-08-19

The formatter reaches the editor. `textDocument/formatting` is served by the language server —
format on save works wherever the editor offers it, in VS Code and the JetBrains IDEs alike,
with no client update needed.

The answer is one whole-document edit off the buffer as it stands, an empty list when the file
already has the shape, and NO edits for a buffer that does not parse: the formatter never
writes a guess over broken text, behind the editor's gesture either. The editor's tab settings
are deliberately ignored — one shape is the tool's contract, in every surface it has.

The toolchain is otherwise unchanged.

## v1.9.0 — 2026-08-19

Two tools. `lyric pack` turns a program into one standalone executable, and `lyric fmt` gives
every Lyric file the one shape there is. The language, the standard library, the bytecode
format and the embedding API are untouched; the format stays **3.2**, and a `.lyrbc` built by
1.8.0 packs and runs unchanged.

### Added

- **`lyric pack app.lyr` — a program becomes one file.**

  ```bash
  lyric pack app.lyr
  ./app arg1 arg2
  ```

  The result is a copy of a prebuilt stub runtime with the compiled module and a 24-byte footer
  appended — a byte copy, no linker, no .NET on the target machine. The packed program owns its
  whole command line (no `--` protocol, no wrapper options), runs with every capability like
  any standalone program, exits with `main`'s return value, and its panics name your lines —
  same runtime, same bytes, same backtraces as `lyric run`.

  Two new binaries carry it: `lyrpack`, which packs a `.lyrbc` and nothing else, and `lyrstub`,
  the runtime half of a packed program. The release archives hold the platform's stub under
  `stubs/<rid>/`; a bare stub started directly explains itself instead of failing obscurely,
  and a truncated pack is reported as damaged rather than executed. The format is specified in
  [`docs/Pack.md`](docs/Pack.md), the guide's chapter 17 says what to know before shipping.
  The release pipeline packs an example and RUNS the result on Windows and Linux before an
  archive exists.

- **`lyric fmt` — the formatter.** In place for files and directories, `--check` for CI (writes
  nothing, exits nonzero when anything would change), `--stdin` for editors. No style options.

  What it keeps: every comment (trailing ones trailing), your blank lines capped at one, your
  literal spellings (`0xFF`, `1_000_000`). What it decides: line breaks against the 100-column
  limit, trailing commas exactly where the grammar allows them and only in broken layout, a
  blank line after the module header and between declarations with bodies. A file that does
  not parse is reported and left byte-for-byte untouched.

  The repository holds itself to it: the standard library, the examples and the templates are
  formatted, and a test fails when they stop being it.

### Changed

- **The standard library, the examples and the project templates are reformatted** with the
  new formatter. No signature, no name and no behaviour changed — the test suite verifies the
  reformatted sources compile to the same programs.

### Not in this release

- **Packed executables that run on macOS.** A Mach-O declares its own extent; appended bytes
  put the file beyond it, and `codesign` refuses the result — found by the release pipeline's
  own gate, recorded in [`docs/Pack.md`](docs/Pack.md). The fix is a real Mach-O segment for
  the payload, deno's route; until then macOS packs for the OTHER platforms via `--stub`.
- **Cross-platform packing sugar**: a pack is for one platform, and a foreign platform packs
  via `--stub` with that platform's stub out of its archive. No `--target` until someone
  needs it.
- **A trimmed stub**: 73.5 MB self-contained today; trimming measures 13.0 MB and survives a
  smoke test, but one smoke is not a gate. Decision material for the next scope check.
- **Capability narrowing at pack time**: a packed program runs with everything, like any
  standalone program. Narrowing is a footer field for a future minor.
- **`textDocument/formatting` in the language server**: the formatter lives in the library the
  server already uses; the wiring is a later slice.
- **Format-on-save configuration, formatter style flags**: deliberately never.

## v1.8.1 — 2026-08-18

A one-line fix for the JetBrains plugin (now 1.2.1): the TextMate bundle provider was registered
under an extension-point namespace that does not exist, so `.lyr` files rendered uncolored while
everything the language server answers worked. The point is declared by the TextMate plugin but
qualified under `com.intellij`; the registration moved there, and highlighting appears. The
toolchain itself is unchanged.

## v1.8.0 — 2026-08-18

The editors catch up with the compiler. No language change and no format change: the language
server compiles the PROJECT instead of the open buffer, answers everything an editor asks, and
two installable clients ship beside the toolchain — the VS Code extension as a `.vsix`, and a
new JetBrains plugin.

### Changed

- **The language server compiles the project, not the buffer.** Under a `lyric.json`, every
  `.lyr` file beneath the source root is one compilation: find-references works in BOTH
  directions (standing on a declaration finds the uses in files that import it), files nobody
  has open get their errors into the Problems panel, a deleted file has its squiggles withdrawn,
  and a change behind the editor — a branch switch, another tool — is picked up through file
  watches. A file outside any project is compiled from itself, as before. Measured: a 14-file
  project checks in the same time as a single file — the standard library dominates either way.

- **Find references and semantic highlighting underline the name, not the expression** — `x`
  instead of `p.x`, `Point` instead of `Point { x = 1 }`.

### Added

- **Rename** (`F2` / `Shift+F6`), project-wide: the declaration, every use, and the `import`
  clauses that carry the name. What cannot be renamed says why — the standard library, a module,
  a built-in. Whether the NEW name collides is left to the compile that follows immediately; its
  diagnostics are the conflict analysis. Applied edits recompile clean, pinned by test.
- **Workspace symbols**: every declaration of the project, searched by name.
- **Semantic highlighting**: every name colored by what the compiler resolved it to — a type in
  an annotation, an initializer and an attribute alike; `let` bindings as readonly. An
  unresolved name stays uncolored, which is the honest signal.
- **Signature help** while typing a call — the declaration as written, the active parameter
  following the commas. **Folding** with the closing line kept visible. **Inlay hints** for the
  inferred type of unannotated bindings and loop variables.
- **The VS Code extension grew up**: a restart command, a status item that shows the server
  state and version, a `lyric: build` task wired to the Problems panel, snippets — and the
  extension ships as `vscode-lyric-<version>.vsix` on every release.
- **A JetBrains plugin** (`jetbrains-lyric-<version>.zip`): the same server in CLion, IntelliJ
  IDEA, Rider and the other commercial IDEs, 2026.1 or newer — diagnostics, completion,
  navigation, rename, semantic highlighting, signature help, folding and inlay hints through
  the platform's own LSP integration. Install from disk; neither client is on a marketplace.

The interpreter stops allocating — and so does the native boundary. No language change and no
format change: the same programs compile to faster, smaller modules, run with far fewer heap
allocations, and a host SDK can now put `Vec2` in a native signature. The numbers below come
from `tools/Bench` (new in this release), Release, per operation, against v1.6.0.

### Changed

- **A function call no longer allocates.** Frames are pooled per function; a call went from
  **176 B to 0 B** and from ~50 ns to ~8 ns. Deep recursion still works, exceptions and panics
  unwind exactly as before.

- **Small functions are inlined.** A direct call to a function of roughly a dozen instructions —
  a `Vec2.add`, an iterator's `next`, a getter — is replaced by its body. Callers and callees
  with `try`/`defer` are left alone, recursion stays a call, and a function that always throws
  keeps its frame.

- **Objects that never leave their function are dissolved into locals.** A `Vec2` built, read
  and assigned inside a loop costs **0 bytes**: construction plus method call went from
  352 B / 271 ns to **0 B / 8 ns**, the operator form (`a + b`) from 352 B / 252 ns to
  **0 B / 6 ns**. This is what makes vector arithmetic through the v1.5.0 operators usable in a
  per-frame game loop.

- **`for-in` no longer allocates its iterator.** A range or array loop runs at **0 B per
  element** (208 B before); a range loop is ~3× faster than in v1.6.0. The `Iterable` route
  through an interface is devirtualized where the concrete iterator is provable — a
  `Set`/`Map` loop now calls its `next` directly instead of dispatching per element.

- **Modules got smaller.** A function whose every call was inlined is removed; the six-function
  `examples/arith.lyr` compiles to two. An attributed function always survives — the row is a
  promise to the host.

- **A panic in an inlined function names the caller's frame with the callee's line.** The line
  is right, the frame above it is gone — the trade every optimizing compiler makes. A
  deliberate `panic(...)` keeps its full backtrace, because a function that never returns is
  not inlined.

### Added

- **The native boundary takes and returns value structs, without allocating.** A native
  signature may use a `struct` declared in the same native module (scalar and string fields
  only). The declaration stays fully typed on the script side; on the wire it is flattened:

  ```lyr
  module engine.geo;

  pub struct Vec2 { x: float, y: float }

  pub fn setPosition(entity: int, at: Vec2);
  pub fn positionOf(entity: int): Vec2;
  ```

  A struct parameter crosses as its fields — the host registers the delegate it would have
  written for scalars. A struct return comes back through a buffer the runtime owns
  (`NativeRegistry.RegisterStructReturning`): the implementation fills one value per field, the
  script sees an ordinary value, and value semantics keeps the shared buffer invisible. Layout
  disagreements between host and SDK are load errors with the import's name in them.

  Measured: a `Vec2` built fresh and passed in, or received back, costs **0 B per call** —
  the answer to the embedding question that produced this milestone (Erato's `positionOf`).

- **A native call no longer allocates its argument array.** The `LyrValue[]` handed to an
  implementation is pooled and reused; a one-argument crossing went from 40 B to 0 B, a
  four-argument one from 88 B to 0 B. The array is therefore a LOAN: read it during the call,
  copy values out, never store it — documented on `NativeRegistry`, and every implementation in
  the standard registry already complied.

- **`tools/Bench`** — the in-process measurement harness behind all numbers above:
  `dotnet run -c Release --project tools/Bench`. Allocated bytes and nanoseconds per operation,
  scalar-loop baseline subtracted, round-robin against JIT tiering, raw-registry boundary
  probes.

### Not in this release

- **Struct returns through the embedding layer's delegates.** `RegisterStructReturning` is a
  `NativeRegistry` surface; a `LangVm.RegisterNative` overload that marshals a C# struct is
  sugar for a later release — the raw form is the one a game host uses anyway.
- **Structs from other modules in native signatures** — the struct must live in the module that
  declares the native, which is where an SDK's value types belong.
- **Escape analysis across surviving calls** — a struct passed to or returned from a *Lyric*
  function that stays a function still allocates.
- **The remaining optional ops in `for-in`**: a range loop still runs ~1.9× a hand-written
  `while`; the gap is `optsome`/`optissome`/`optget` and block hops, peephole material.
- **Value structs as a language feature.** Deliberately: a `struct` already HAS value
  semantics; this release makes the representation keep that promise everywhere it matters,
  with no new mechanism.

## v1.6.0 — 2026-08-18

Attributes. A program can say things about itself that a tool outside it can read — which
functions a host should call, what a script-declared type looks like, what a module is. The
bytecode format goes **3.1 → 3.2**; both new sections are skippable, so a 1.5.0 runtime loads a
1.6.0 module and runs it unchanged.

### Added

- **Attributes, on a function, a type and the module header.** An attribute is a struct type;
  where it may sit is the marker interface it declares — `OnModule`, `OnType` or `OnFunction`, all
  new in `std.core`:

  ```lyr
  import std.core { OnType, OnFunction };

  pub struct Component :: [OnType] { }
  pub struct System :: [OnFunction] { order: int = 0 }

  @Component
  pub struct Health { value: int, max: int }

  @System { order = 10 }
  pub fn damageTick(dt: float): void { }
  ```

  Conformance decides, not the name — no struct becomes an attribute by accident, the same nominal
  rule the operators follow. The arguments are the struct initializer restricted to literals; a
  field the use does not write carries the field's literal default, and a field with neither is an
  error at the use site, not a hole in the metadata.

  **An attribute describes; it does nothing.** No attribute in this release is read by the
  compiler, and a runtime that ignores them runs the program unchanged.

- **Bytecode format 3.2.** Section 11 holds the rows — target, attribute type, one value per field
  in field order, always complete. Section 12 holds field names, ONLY for types a row references:
  everywhere else the rule stands that field names are not in the bytecode, but a host reading
  `@Component struct Health` needs `value` and `max`, or it has learned a shape it cannot name.

  An attributed function survives dead-code elimination: the row is a promise that the index is
  valid, and the host is a caller the reachability analysis cannot see — the same standing as the
  entry point.

- **The embedding API reads the rows.** `ScriptModule.Attributes` answers **before**
  `Instantiate` — for foreign bytes, the module row is how a host decides whether to load at all.
  A hit is a call handle: `instance.CallVoid(use, …)` calls by the index the row carries, so a
  typo in a script is a compile error instead of a function nobody finds. `FieldsOf` yields the
  named, typed shape of an attributed type.

- **The tools show them.** `lyric disasm` prints each row with its field names, `lyrvm info`
  counts them, and hovering `@System` in an editor answers with the struct.

### Fixed

- **A duplicate field in a struct initializer crashed the compiler.** `P { x = 1, x = 2 }` passed
  the type checker and died in the lowering with an internal exception instead of an error
  message. It is a diagnostic now (`LYR-SEM0070`), reported at each repeated field, in struct and
  class initializers and in enum struct-variant initializers alike. Found while building the
  attribute checks, which validate their arguments the same way.

### Changed

- **`@name` at declaration position is no longer "attributes arrive later".** It parses; what the
  name resolves to is the sema's question, so `@test` is now `unknown type 'test'` instead of
  `LYR-PAR0038`. That code stays on parameters, where attributes remain rejected, with a message
  that no longer promises the future. The reserved expression form `@name(args)` leaves the
  grammar; `LYR-SEM0053` now says an attribute is not an expression.

### Not in this release

- **Attributes on parameters, fields and members** — top-level declarations and the module header
  only.
- **Attributes the compiler reads** (`@Deprecated`, `@MustUse`, `@Inline`): the moment one
  attribute changes compilation, the attribute set becomes part of the language contract and the
  stability promise. That is a separate decision, deliberately not smuggled in here.
- **Runtime application**, Python-decorator style: there is no mechanism by which an attribute
  wraps or replaces its target.
- **Qualified attribute names**: names are the bytecode's type names and therefore unqualified.
  An SDK owns its attribute names the way it owns its native names.
- **Completion after `@`.**

## v1.5.0 — 2026-08-18

Operators on your types. Everything resolves through the one mechanism this language has for
polymorphism — the interface a type declares — so there is no operator declaration syntax, no new
opcode, and the `.lyrbc` format stays **3.1**.

### Added

- **`==` and `!=` on every type conforming to `Equatable<T>`.** The operator *is* the method:
  `a == b` calls `a.equals(b)`, and `a != b` negates it.

  ```lyr
  struct Point :: [Equatable<Point>] {
      x: int,
      fn equals(other: Point): bool { return this.x == other.x; }
  }

  let same = a == b;
  ```

  Conformance is required, not the method alone: a type with an `equals` nobody declared as
  `Equatable` stays rejected, so no method becomes an operator by accident of its name.

- **`<`, `<=`, `>` and `>=` on every type conforming to `Ordered<T>`** — one `compare` method,
  negative/zero/positive, and all four operators read its sign. **`string < string` works**, through
  the conformance the standard library has carried since v1.0; its rejection had promised exactly
  this change.

- **`+`, `-`, `*` and `/` on types conforming to `Add<T>`, `Sub<T>`, `Mul<T>` and `Div<T>`** — four
  new `std.core` interfaces, one method each, homogeneous: `T op T` gives `T`. The built-in numerics
  conform, `string` to `Add` alone, so a generic function constrained on `Add<T>` serves an `int`, a
  `string` and your vector type in one program.

- **`as` beyond the numerics converts through `Into<T>`.** `x as T` is `x.into()` where the
  operand's type declares the conformance. Explicit only, one target per type, total conversions
  only — a conversion that can fail belongs in a named function returning an optional. The numeric
  casts keep their opcodes and are not overridable.

- **`s *= 3` and `xs *= 2` work.** The repetition overloads of `*` had no compound form — an
  accident of how compounds were checked, recorded as a limit. The compound check rework below
  delivered them.

### Fixed

- **A compound assignment never checked its operator.** `p += p` on a struct passed the compiler and
  produced an integer addition of two references at runtime — the `s += "x"` class of bug fixed in
  v1.1.0, one type over. `s &= s` and `f <<= f` passed the same way. A compound is now typed as the
  binary it carries: whatever `a = a + b` says, `a += b` says too.

### Not in this release

- **Heterogeneous operands** (`Vec2 * float`): needs a two-parameter interface and a rule for
  multiple conformances to one generic interface.
- **Compound assignment through the operator interfaces** (`v += w` on a `Vec2`): the compound
  lowering evaluates the target's address once and cannot yet route through a call. The diagnostic
  says to write `v = v + w`.
- **`%` on user types**, and unary `-`: no interface exists for either, deliberately.
- **A conversion out of a builtin** (`extend int :: [Into<Cents>]`): the orphan rule stops it, and
  the rule does not look into type arguments. A named function takes its place.
- **Method overloading**, considered and rejected: constraints plus generics are this language's
  overloading, and the standard library says so itself.

## v1.4.0 — 2026-08-17

Completion, and a standard library that says what it does. The language, the command line, the
embedding API and the `.lyrbc` format are untouched; the format stays **3.1**.

### Added

- **Completion.** After a `.` the members of what stands before it; anywhere else the names in
  scope.

  ```lyr
  let p = Point { x = 1 };
  p.          // x, y, and every method, extension and interface default the type has
  ```

  The member list is the one the compiler would accept, not an approximation of it: extension methods
  and interface default methods are in it, which matters because **every string method of this
  standard library is an extension** — a list without them would be empty on a `string`.

  In scope: locals, parameters, type parameters, what the module declares and imports, and the
  builtins. Inner names shadow outer ones, a binding is not offered inside its own initializer, and a
  loop variable is not offered in the loop head.

  Each item carries its kind and, when the declaration has one, the `///` block above it.

  It works while the file does not parse, which is the state it is asked in. The trigger character
  is `.`; everything else is the editor asking on its own.

- **The standard library documents itself where it did not.** `std.io.console`, `std.core` and
  `std.option` held 33 public declarations and no documentation at all, so hovering `println` showed
  a signature and nothing else. All three are written now, interface members included.

### Fixed

- **A struct initializer is a reference to its type.** Asking for the definition of `Point` in
  `let p = Point { x = 1 };` used to answer nothing, and find-references did not list it. Both do
  now, and hovering it reports the type.

  v1.3.0 listed this under *Not in this release* because recording it made the type checker read
  `Pair<int> { a = 6 }.a` as a static member access. The receiver question is answered from the
  expression's type now rather than from that table, so the two no longer collide.

### Not in this release

- **Completion does not offer keywords.** `if`, `return` and the rest are not symbols; an editor gets
  them from the grammar it highlights with.
- **Completion after `import` does not offer module paths.** That is a different source — the file
  system — and not the scope.
- **A field reference still marks the whole member access**: asking for references to `x` marks
  `p.x`. Use sites carry no span for their name alone.
- **References and completion stop at the compilation.** The server compiles the file you are in, so
  another file of your project that imports it is not searched.

## v1.3.1 — 2026-08-17

### Fixed

- **Eight diagnostics pointed at a document that does not exist.** Five named `Sprache.md`, which has
  been [`docs/Grammar.md`](docs/Grammar.md) for some time, and the sections they cited were wrong as
  well — §10 and §11 of a document that has seven. Following either reference led nowhere twice:

  ```
  attributes are not part of v1 (Sprache.md §10); '@test' and 'lyric test' arrive after v1.0
  ```

  ```
  attributes are not part of v1; '@test' and 'lyric test' arrive later
  ```

  Rather than repair the citations, they are gone. **A diagnostic names what is wrong, not where to
  read about it** — a citation ages in two ways at once, and both had already happened here. Where a
  reference carried information (`§11 allows none or one 'string[]'`), the message now says it
  outright.

  The affected codes are `LYR-PAR0038`, `LYR-PAR0039`, `LYR-SEM0053`, the lowering's *main* check,
  the bytecode reader's global check and two entry-point findings of the IR verifier. **No code
  changed and no behaviour changed** — only the wording, so a program that compiled still compiles
  and one that did not still fails, with the same code on the same span.

## v1.3.0 — 2026-08-17

Everything in this release is the language server. The language, the standard library, the command
line and the `.lyrbc` format are untouched; the format stays **3.1**.

### Added

- **Hover shows the documentation you wrote.** A `///` block above a declaration appears under its
  signature, for declarations in the file you are editing and in every module it reads:

  ```
  fn cpuCount() -> int

  How many cores the machine has, for programs that split their work. The VM itself is
  single-threaded.
  ```

  The text goes through unchanged — there is no doc-comment vocabulary in the grammar, so nothing is
  interpreted, and nothing is composed from the signature. A declaration without a block is shown
  exactly as before.

- **An editor can show the outline of a file** (`textDocument/documentSymbol`). Types carry their
  fields, methods, variants and static constants as children; imports, parameters and locals are
  left out, because an outline says what a file offers.

  It reads the syntax and resolves nothing, which is why **a file with type errors still has an
  outline** — the moment you most want one.

  Only the nested form is produced. An editor that does not announce
  `hierarchicalDocumentSymbolSupport` gets no outline rather than the deprecated flat one.

- **Find all references** (`textDocument/references`), with or without the declaration itself. The
  answer covers the program reachable from the file you are in, so a call into the standard library
  is found in the module that declares it.

### Changed

- **Go to definition selects the NAME of a declaration**, not the start of it. Previously the cursor
  landed on the first character of the whole declaration — on `for` for a loop variable, on `catch`
  for a catch binding. An editor that announces `linkSupport` now also receives the full extent of
  the declaration beside the name, so a peek window shows the declaration and puts the cursor on its
  name.

### Fixed

- **Go to definition on a struct initializer no longer jumps somewhere else.** In
  `let p = Point { x = 1 };`, asking about `Point` used to land on `p` — the enclosing binding, which
  is not what the cursor was on. It now answers with nothing. What it *cannot* yet do is answer with
  `Point`; see below.

### Not in this release

- **A struct initializer is not a reference to its type.** `Point { … }` is bound to no symbol, so
  neither find-references nor go-to-definition sees it. An annotation (`let p: Point`) is found.
- **A field reference marks the whole member access**: asking for references to `x` marks `p.x`, not
  the `x` in it. Use sites carry no span for their name alone.
- **References stop at the compilation.** The server compiles the file you are in; another file of
  your project that imports it is not part of that compile, and its uses are therefore not listed.
- **No completion.** It is the first question asked at a position where the text does not parse,
  which is a compiler topic rather than another editor feature.

## v1.2.0 — 2026-08-17

### Changed

- **Only a field needs the `,` that separates members of a struct or class.** A bodiless method used
  to need a semicolon *and* a comma in a row:

  ```lyr
  class Builder {
      fn addExecutable(entry: string, output: string): Artifact;,   // no longer
      fn addTest(entry: string): Artifact;
  }
  ```

  The rule is strictly more permissive, so every file that was valid stays valid — the comma is still
  accepted where it is now optional. Two fields still need one, or `a: int b: int` would read as a
  single field of a type nobody wrote.

### Added

- **`lyric new` writes a project that builds.**

  ```bash
  lyric new myapp          # lyric.json, build.lyr, .gitignore, src/main.lyr
  lyric new mylib --lib    # lyric.json, src/mylib.lyr — nothing to build
  ```

  Two shapes and two flags rather than a template system: with two variants a discovery mechanism is
  more machinery than content. The name becomes a module name, so it has to be one, and an existing
  directory that holds something is refused rather than merged into.

  The templates are embedded in the binary, so nothing can go missing beside it — and they are real
  `.lyr` files in the repository, which the test suite compiles. `__name__` is a valid Lyric
  identifier, so a template is compilable Lyric rather than text with holes in it.

  It is the one command the driver runs itself: it writes files and compiles nothing.

- **A project may be built by a script, `build.lyr`.** `lyric build` without a file argument runs it
  and compiles what it declares:

  ```lyr
  import std.build { addExecutable };

  pub fn build() {
      let app = addExecutable("src/main.lyr", "out/app.lyrbc");
      app.sourceMap(false);

      addExecutable("tools/mktex.lyr", "out/mktex.lyrbc");
  }
  ```

  Every artifact is compiled whole, from its entry file; there is no link step and nothing is shared
  between two of them but the source on disk. `lyric build` **with** a file still means "compile this
  file" and is unchanged.

  Nothing is compiled while the script runs — it collects, and the compiles happen once `build` has
  returned. That is why an option set on the following line still applies, and why a source file the
  script generates is finished before anything reads it.

  It is a Lyric program with the whole standard library and every capability, so it may write files
  and start processes. Relative paths in it resolve against the directory holding `build.lyr`, not
  against the directory the build was started from. **`lyric build` in a repository you did not write
  runs code you did not write**, as `make` and `cmake` do.

  New binary `lyrbuild`, the second after `lyrrepl` that holds both the front end and the runtime: a
  build script has to run, and what it collects has to be compiled afterwards.

- **A project may say where its modules are, in a `lyric.json`.**

  ```json
  {
    // where our own modules live
    "sourceRoot": "src",
    "nativeRoots": { "engine": "sdk" },
  }
  ```

  `sourceRoot` replaces "the directory of the entry file" as the module root, and `nativeRoots` maps
  a module path segment to a directory whose modules may declare functions without a body. The file
  is searched for upwards from the file being compiled, and comments and trailing commas are allowed
  in it.

  **This closes the gap v1.1.0 shipped with**: `lyric check` and `lyric build` now see the native
  roots a host declares, so a script written against an SDK no longer compiles in the host and fails
  on the command line.

  Both keys are optional and **without the file nothing changes** — that is what makes it an addition
  rather than a new requirement. A key nobody knows is a warning rather than an error, so a file
  written for a later version still loads.

  It is read and never executed, which is what lets an editor learn a project's layout without
  running anything from it.

- **The language server follows a program across its files.** Editing a module now refreshes the
  diagnostics of every open file that imports it, and a dependency is read from the editor's buffer
  rather than from its last save. Both halves are needed: an overlay nobody re-reads shows nothing,
  and a cascade over stale text refreshes to the same answer.

  What a file depends on is taken from the compilation itself, not from the imports in its text —
  the resolver already followed them, transitively and through the project's roots, and a second
  answer to that question would be the one that is wrong.

  The cascade goes one level. Two modules may import each other, which is a diagnostic rather than a
  crash, so a transitive one would not terminate.

  `CompilerOptions.SourceOverlay` is the seam, and it is not editor-specific: it says "compile as if
  these files held this text", which a host embedding the compiler can use for the same reason.

- **The language server reads `lyric.json`.** An import of a host SDK no longer shows as an unknown
  module in an editor while the same script runs correctly in the host — the second half of what
  v1.1.0 listed as not in it.

  A broken project file does not stop the analysis. The editor keeps getting diagnostics, resolved
  by the plain rules, and the reason goes to the client's log; publishing nothing would leave an
  earlier state on screen with no hint that anything happened. The message names the project file
  rather than appearing as an error inside the file being edited, and it is said once per change
  rather than once per keystroke.

  **Still not there**: editing a module does not refresh the diagnostics of the file that imports
  it. The server analyses one buffer at a time.

## v1.1.0 — 2026-08-15

Bytecode format **3.1**. A minor of the format may only add skippable sections, so a 1.0 runtime
reads a module built by this release and a 1.1 runtime reads one built by 1.0 — with one caveat
below.

### Added

- **A host may ship its API as `.lyr` files instead of generating it.** `HostOptions.NativeRoots`
  names directories whose modules may declare functions without a body, keyed by the module path
  segment they own, and `LangVm.RegisterNative` supplies the implementations under the same qualified
  names. Until now every host function went through `RegisterFunction`, which derives the declaration
  from the delegate — right for a handful, and for an SDK it means the same signature lives in the
  C# call and in whatever documents the API.

  Whether a module may declare a native follows the ROOT it came from, never its content, so naming
  a file well enough is not a way into the host. A module in such a root may hold ordinary Lyric code
  beside its declarations.

- **A program may consist of several files.** A module path becomes a file path under the directory
  of the entry file: `import shapes.circle` reads `shapes/circle.lyr` beside it. Until now only the
  standard library could be imported, so every program was one file.

  Three rules come with it. A file must agree with the path it was loaded from, or the header is an
  error — previously such a file registered under the name its header claimed and the import that
  pulled it in reported *cannot find module* about a file it had just read. `std` resolves against
  the standard library alone, so nothing beside your program can take its place. And only standard
  library modules declare functions without a body; in your own modules a missing body is a compiler
  error rather than a failure at load time.

  Everything still compiles into one `.lyrbc`. There is no separate compilation step per file.

- **A panic names the line it happened on**, not just the function:

  ```
  panic [LYR-VM0002]: division by zero
      in main.divide (app.lyr:3)
      in main.main (app.lyr:8)
  ```

  The innermost frame points at the instruction that failed, every frame below it at the call it was
  waiting on.

- **The SourceMap section of the bytecode format now has a payload.** It was reserved and named in
  3.0 and never written. It maps a byte offset in a function's code to a file and a line, one row per
  position change.

- **`lyrc build --no-source-map`** leaves the section out. Without it the file is byte for byte what
  the same build produced before the section existed, so stripping costs nothing else. The section is
  written by default: the moment a line number is wanted is the moment nobody planned for it.

  Paths are stored relative to the entry file's directory, and a file outside it — the standard
  library sits beside the toolchain — keeps its bare name. Nothing absolute reaches the file, so a
  module does not carry the directory layout of the machine that built it.

### Fixed

- **`s += "x"` on a string silently produced the empty string.** `+` on a `string` is a call to
  `std.string.concat` and on an array an `arrcat` instruction, but the compound forms emitted a bare
  `add` with the operand type next to it. Nothing rejected that in a release build, and the runtime
  read the two strings as integers, so the variable ended up empty and the program kept running:

  ```lyr
  var line = "";
  line += "0F ";     // line was "" afterwards, not "0F "
  ```

  Affected were a local, a captured variable and a coroutine local. On an **array** the same
  instruction produced a value with no reference, and the next access to it ended the process with a
  host exception instead of a panic. A field (`obj.s += "x"`) and an array element
  (`xs[0] += "x"`) were reported as `LYR-IR0001` rather than miscompiled, and now work as well.

  `s = s + "x"` was correct throughout and is unchanged. **Existing `.lyrbc` files are unaffected**:
  the format and its specification were right, the compiler was not.

  `s *= 3` and `xs *= 2` stay rejected — a separate rule in the type checker demands that the right
  operand be assignable to the left, which does not hold for repetition. `s = s * 3` works.

- **A runtime accepted an arithmetic opcode with a type it cannot compute on.** §5 of the format says
  `add` through `rem` require a numeric type; the reader checked indices only and never the type tag,
  so a module carrying `add string` passed `lyrvm verify` and ran. That is why the bug above could
  reach an output at all — the IR verifier that does catch it runs in debug builds only. Such a
  module is now rejected at load time with `LYR-BC0005`.

- **A reader rejected a section id it did not know**, with `LYR-BC0003`, instead of skipping it. That
  is the mechanism the format's forward compatibility rests on, and it had never run, because nothing
  had ever written an unknown section.

  **This is the caveat above**: a 1.0.1 runtime cannot read a module carrying a SourceMap, even
  though the format says it must. Building with `--no-source-map` produces a module those runtimes
  accept.

### Not in this release

- **The command line does not know native roots.** `HostOptions.NativeRoots` reaches the compiler
  through the embedding API alone, so `lyric check` and the language server report an unknown module
  for an import a host resolves at runtime. Scripts written against an SDK run correctly and look
  wrong in an editor.
- **The language server does not know multi-file programs.** It compiles the buffer it was given, so
  editing `util.lyr` does not refresh the diagnostics of the `app.lyr` that imports it. Reopening or
  editing the importing file does.

Both need a place where a project says what it consists of, and putting that on the command line
would make a third place where the layout is written down.

## v1.0.1 — 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- **A module with both a module-level `let` and a `try`/`catch` compiled to a file that would not
  load.** The compiler wrote the Globals section (id 10) ahead of the Handlers section (id 9), and
  section ids must ascend strictly, so `lyric run` and `lyrvm verify` rejected the compiler's own
  output with `LYR-BC0005`. `lyric check` and `lyric build` reported success beforehand, which is
  what made it look like a runtime problem rather than an emitter one.

  Only a module carrying both sections was affected; either one on its own was written correctly and
  is unchanged. No `.lyrbc` file that used to be valid changes — the format and its specification
  were already right and the writer was not, so the bytecode format stays **3.0**.

## v1.0.0 — 2026-08-14

The first release with a compatibility promise. Everything below describes the state it ships, not
a change against v0.9.0: there is no earlier entry to compare against.

From here on the `.lyrbc` format and the language carry the promise the versioning describes: a
minor may add, a major may break.

### Language

The whole grammar in [`docs/Grammar.md`](docs/Grammar.md) compiles and runs: functions, structs and
classes, enums with `match`, interfaces with default methods and `::` conformance, generics with
constraints, optionals, exceptions with `throws` and `defer`, closures, coroutines, modules, and
`extend` blocks on own and primitive types.

Fixed against v0.9.0, each of them a case that used to be refused or to fail late:

- An **argument position** now carries an expected type, so `f(Opt.Some(5))` names its instance
  instead of requiring `f(Opt<int>.Some(5))`.
- A **generic struct initializer** takes its instance from the surrounding type:
  `let p: P<int> = P { v = 1 }`. Written type arguments still win, and there is still no inference
  from the field values.
- A **`type` alias** works in every position — as a return type and a field type too, not only as a
  parameter type and a local annotation.
- **`static fn`** is allowed in an enum and an `extend` body. An interface member stays non-static:
  it is reached through a vtable slot, which takes a receiver.
- A **cyclic type alias** (`type A = B; type B = A;`) is a diagnostic instead of ending the compiler
  process.

### Toolchain

- `lyric` (driver), `lyrc` (compiler), `lyrvm` (runtime), `lyrrepl` (interactive prompt), and
  `lyrembed.dll` for a C# host.
- **`lyric check` answers the same question as `lyric build`.** It used to stop after type checking
  and report `ok` for programs the backend could not express.
- Releases ship a **self-contained archive per platform** (`win-x64`, `linux-x64`, `osx-arm64`) that
  runs without a .NET install.

### Documentation

- A static documentation site generated by `tools/DocGen`: the guide, both specifications, and a
  standard library reference generated from the `.lyr` signatures. One frozen directory per version.

### Not in this release

- No interface inheritance; require both interfaces side by side.
- No operator overloading, so `==` and `<` on user types stay ordinary methods.
- No attributes (`@test` and the rest).
- The source map section of the bytecode format is reserved but not written, so a panic names the
  function rather than the line.
