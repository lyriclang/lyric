/// `extend` blocks, inherent and through an interface.

/// <para>An extension method is an ordinary function with the receiver as parameter 0. No new IR type,
/// no opcode, no format bump: the inherent call is a direct <c>call</c>, because the compiler knows
/// statically which type stands at the receiver. The interface form fills the same vtable row as a
/// declared conformance, and which of the two established it is no longer distinguishable at runtime.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>Three tests here matter more than the rest, and each measures something that would otherwise
/// be silently wrong. First: an extension does NOT displace a member of the same name — the sema does
/// not report the case, it simply lets the own member win — and without the <c>&lt;extend&gt;</c> infix
/// in the mangling a cleanly type-checked program crashes in the verifier. Second: a builtin receiver
/// arrives as argument 0, which failed while building, because a scalar is no <c>NamedRef</c> and
/// therefore fell into the type or module branch of the call lowering. Third: the conformance tests
/// carry TWO implementations, one declared and one through <c>extend</c>; with only one the test would
