/// An emit cursor over the basic blocks of a function: creates blocks, writes instructions into the

///
/// <para>DENSE BLOCK IDS ARE STRUCTURALLY GUARANTEED: <see cref="Append"/> forms the id from
/// <c>Count</c> and appends the block immediately afterwards, so <c>Blocks[i].Id.Value == i</c> always
/// holds. The first block created is <c>bb0</c> and therefore the entry, which gives the second
/// verifier invariant for free.</para>
///
/// <para>WHY <see cref="SealBlock"/> CAN SEAL A FOREIGN BLOCK: an <c>if</c> branch may only jump
/// forward once it is settled that a merge block exists at all, and that is known only after both
/// branches are lowered. By then the cursor has long moved on. The alternative would be to create the
/// merge block eagerly and remove it when unused, which breaks density as soon as the branch created
/// blocks of its own.</para>
///
/// <para>The order of the blocks in the list is creation order rather than control-flow order: for
/// loops the exit block has to exist before the body is lowered, because a <c>break</c> in the body
/// needs its jump target, so it stands before the body blocks. That is correct and dense, but does not
/// read linearly in the dump.</para>
