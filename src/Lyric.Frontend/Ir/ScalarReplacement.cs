///
/// <para>WHAT MAKES IT SOUND HERE. Locals are frame-private — no call, no other frame and no
/// object can read them — so the whole analysis is a walk over one function's instructions. A
/// temp is defined exactly once, so every derived pointer has exactly one source. And an object
/// is only ever scalarized while provably in SOLE OWNERSHIP: every store into its local is a
/// private allocation, every read from it is a field access, and anything else — a call
/// argument, a return, a store into another object or a second local, an interface value, a
/// throw — disqualifies the group. Under sole ownership, one set of field locals per LOCAL is
/// reference semantics and value semantics at once, which is why classes (the iterators) and
/// structs (`Vec2`) take the same path.</para>
///
/// <para>A <c>structcopy</c> is treated as an allocation whose init copies every field from its
/// source — but only for types without struct-typed fields, because the runtime copy is deep and
/// the field-wise one is not.</para>

/// <para>Functions with handlers are skipped whole, as in the inliner: a catch slot is a local
/// written by the unwinder, which is exactly the kind of invisible writer this analysis assumes
