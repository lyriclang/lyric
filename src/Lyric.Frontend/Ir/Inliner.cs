/// <para>The frame is the cost this removes: after pooling a call still pays argument copying,
/// dispatch and two array writes per slot, which for a three-line method is more than the method.
/// Inlining is also what makes scalar replacement possible at all — a value that is returned
/// escapes its own function, but not the caller it was inlined into.</para>
///
/// <para>ON THE IR, LIKE THE REACHABILITY ANALYSIS, and cheap for the same reason: dispatch is
/// static, generics are monomorphized, and values cross block boundaries through locals rather
/// than phis — splicing foreign blocks is renumbering plus one branch in, one branch out.</para>
///
/// <para>WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT INLINED:</para>
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item>A caller with handlers. Handler ranges are contiguous block ranges, and spliced blocks
/// land at the end of the block list — outside every range. A throw from the spliced body would
/// sail past the very catch that used to receive it. Skipping such callers keeps ranges honest;
/// hot loops do not carry try blocks.</item>
/// <item>A callee with handlers or an <c>endfinally</c>, for the mirrored reason: its ranges
/// cannot come along.</item>
/// <item>A self call. Mutual recursion needs no analysis beyond this: splicing a cycle
/// eventually surfaces the call to the function itself, which is refused, and the size budget
/// bounds everything before that.</item>
/// <item>Dynamic calls — <c>callvirt</c>, <c>callind</c>, imports. Their target is not in the
/// instruction.</item>
/// </list>

/// <para>The spliced instructions KEEP THE CALLEE'S SPANS: a panic then names the right line in
/// the right file, but the frame it names is the caller's — the same trade every optimizing
/// compiler makes, and the cheaper half of inline debug info.</para>
///
/// <para>The pass relies on definite assignment: a callee local is written before it is read, so
/// reusing its caller slot across loop iterations cannot expose a stale value. The sema
/// guarantees that for written code; the lowering's synthetic locals hold it by construction.</para>
