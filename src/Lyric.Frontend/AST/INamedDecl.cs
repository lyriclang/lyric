/// <para>A declaration's own span covers everything it declares — a function includes its body, a
/// loop its statements — so it answers "how far does this reach" and not "where does this name
/// stand". The two are the same only for a declaration that fits its name exactly, which is none of
/// them. <see cref="NameSpan"/> is the second answer, and it is recorded where the name is read
/// rather than searched for afterwards: the parser holds the identifier token at that moment, and
/// looking for the text again later would find the wrong occurrence in
/// <c>fn area(area: int)</c>.</para>
///
/// <para><see cref="NameSpan"/> always lies within <see cref="Span"/>. Consumers rely on the
/// containment — the language server reports the pair as a range and the selection inside it, and
/// the protocol requires the inner one to be enclosed by the outer.</para>
///
/// <para>Implemented by every node whose name is a plain string field. A name that is a node of its
/// own — a binding or field pattern — carries its span already and needs nothing from here.</para>
