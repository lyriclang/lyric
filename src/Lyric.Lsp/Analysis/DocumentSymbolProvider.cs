///
/// <para>Every entry needs two ranges, and both are already there: a declaration's own span is what

/// <para>Only the NESTED form is produced. The protocol's flat alternative is deprecated, has no
/// notion of children, and needs a container name per entry; supporting both would be two answer
/// shapes with different semantics rather than one with a flag. A client that does not announce
/// <c>hierarchicalDocumentSymbolSupport</c> is answered with nothing — no current editor is in that
/// position, and an outline that is absent beats one that is malformed.</para>
