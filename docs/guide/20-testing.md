# Testing

Tests live in a directory of their own — `tests/` beside your `lyric.json`, or wherever its
`testRoot` points — and only `lyric test` ever compiles them. A production build never sees a
test file, so nothing has to be stripped and nothing ships by accident.

A test is a top-level function marked `@Test`, taking nothing and returning nothing. It fails by
panicking, which is what the assertions in `std.test` do:

```lyr
import std.test { Test, assertEq, assertTrue };

fn double(n: int): int {
    return n * 2;
}

@Test
pub fn doubling_doubles(): void {
    assertEq(double(2), 4);
}

@Test
pub fn doubling_keeps_the_sign(): void {
    assertTrue(double(-3) < 0, "the sign must survive");
}
```

```bash
lyric test
```

```
PASS math_tests.doubling_doubles
PASS math_tests.doubling_keeps_the_sign
2 test(s), all passed
```

The runner compiles every `.lyr` under the test root, finds the `@Test` functions through the
module's attribute rows — the same machinery a host uses to find `@System` functions — and runs
each in a **fresh instance**: module state cannot leak between tests, because no two tests share
an instance. A failing assertion names both values (`expected 5, got 4`); a panic fails the test
with its backtrace; the exit code is `0` when everything passed and `1` otherwise, which is all
a CI step needs.

**What a fresh instance does not reset is what a test OPENED.** A file, socket or child process
belongs to the VM, and the runner uses one VM per test FILE — so a test that opens a file and
does not close it holds it until the rest of that file's tests have run, and on Windows the file
stays locked against them. Tests in other files are unaffected. Close what you open, in a `defer`
if the test can fail in between, and a test that means to leave a handle open belongs in a file
of its own.

Test files are ordinary programs of your project: they import your modules through the
`sourceRoot` the `lyric.json` declares, and the whole standard library and every capability are
theirs — a test is your own code running on your own machine, the same standing `lyric run`
has.

A project without a `tests/` directory has no tests, and `lyric test` says so and exits `0`. A
`testRoot` your `lyric.json` names explicitly is a promise, though: if the directory is missing,
that is an error.

`assertEq` wants `[Equatable<T>, Display]` — the comparison needs the one, naming both values in
the failure needs the other. Every built-in scalar and `string` satisfy both; for your own types
you declare the conformances, as [chapter 7](07-interfaces.md) shows.
