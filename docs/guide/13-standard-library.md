# The standard library

The standard library is written in Lyric and ships as source alongside the toolchain.

| Module | Contents |
|---|---|
| `std.core` | `panic`, `assert`, `todo`, `unreachable`, `Exception`, `Display`, `Hashable`, `Equatable`, `Ordered` |
| `std.string` | inspection, search, split, join, trim, pad, parsing, `StringBuilder` |
| `std.fmt` | number formatting, padding, alignment, tables |
| `std.math` | `sqrt`, `pi`, `abs`, `min`, `max`, rounding, trigonometry |
| `std.collections` | `List<T>`, `Map<K, V>`, `Set<T>`, `Indexable<T>`, sorting |
| `std.iter` | `Iterator<T>`, `Iterable<T>`, adapters, `sum` |
| `std.option` | `map`, `andThen`, `filter`, `zip`, `contains`, `toArray`, `iter`, `expect` |
| `std.io.console` | `print`, `println`, `readLine` — the writers take any `Display` value: `println(42)` |
| `std.io.file` | reading and writing files — requires `fileAccess` |
| `std.os` | environment, process, exit — requires `osAccess` |
| `std.random` | `Random.seeded`, `shuffle`, `choice`, `nextGaussian` — deterministic, no capability |
| `std.time` | `Instant`, `Duration`, ISO 8601 — requires `osAccess` |
| `std.build` | `addExecutable` — only a `build.lyr` run by `lyric build` can use it |

## Collections

`List<T>` grows; `T[]` does not.

```lyr
import std.io.console { println };
import std.collections { List };

fn main(): int {
    let items = List<string>.empty();
    items.push("first");
    items.push("second");

    for (item in items) {
        println(item);
    }

    let copy = items.toArray();
    return copy.length;
}
```

## Iteration

Anything implementing `Iterable<T>` works with `for-in`, including your own types.

```lyr
import std.io.console { println };
import std.iter { Iterator, Iterable };

class Countdown :: [Iterable<int>] {
    from: int,

    fn iter(): Iterator<int> {
        return CountdownIter { remaining = this.from };
    }
}

class CountdownIter :: [Iterator<int>] {
    remaining: int,

    mut fn next(): ?int {
        if (this.remaining <= 0) { return null; }
        let value = this.remaining;
        this.remaining = this.remaining - 1;
        return value;
    }
}

fn main(): int {
    var total = 0;
    for (n in Countdown { from = 3 }) {
        total = total + n;
    }
    println(f"{total}");
    return total;
}
```

An `Iterator<T>` yields `?T` and signals the end with `null`. `Iterable<T>` hands out a fresh
iterator per call, so two loops over the same collection do not interfere.

## One name per type, not overloads

Lyric has no overloading, so the library distinguishes by the type in the NAME. `std.math` carries
both families side by side:

| float | int |
|---|---|
| `min`, `max` | `minInt`, `maxInt` |
| `clamp` | `clampInt` |
| `abs`, `sign` | `absInt`, `signInt` |

`clamp(index, 0, count - 1)` on three `int`s is therefore `cannot assign 'int' to 'float'`, and
the answer is `clampInt` rather than a conversion there and back. The same rule shapes
`fromInt`/`fromFloat` and `parseInt`/`parseFloat` in `std.string`.

## Files answer two ways, and each says which

Since 2.14 `std.io.file` has exactly two shapes, and the choice between them is not a taste:

```lyr
import std.io.file as file;

fn main(): int {
    let path = "notes.txt";

    let content = file.text(path) ?? "";        // a READ answers ?T
    let saved = file.writeText(path, content);  // an OPERATION answers bool

    return if (saved) 0 else 1;
}
```

A **read** answers `?T`: `null` means the file could not be read, and an empty result means an
empty file. A **write, a remove, a copy** answers `bool` — whether it happened; it carries no
value, so nothing is lost by saying only that. A **predicate** (`exists`, `isFile`,
`isDirectory`) answers `bool` too, and there `false` is an answer rather than a failure.

Before 2.14 there were three shapes, and the third one lied: `readBytes` and `readLines` answered
an **empty array** both for an empty file and for a file that is not there. No caller could tell
those apart, and the advice was to ask `exists` first — which is a race, not an answer. The three
old names still work and warn (`readText`, `readBytes`, `readLines`); they go with 3.0, and the
compiler will say so on the day.

What none of the shapes carries is a REASON: a missing file and a permission denied look the
same. That gap is known and left open on purpose — carrying reasons means an error type and a
decision about `throws` that this module should not make on its own.

## Capabilities

`std.io.file`, `std.io.net` and `std.os` require a capability. A standalone run grants
everything; a host grants explicitly, and a module that requires more than it is granted is
rejected before it runs.

## Strings have methods

Since v1.15 the string API is method-shaped: `s.trim()`, `s.split(",")`, `s.contains(x)`,
`s.length()`. The deprecated free forms (`trim(s)`, …) went with 2.0. `concat` and `repeat`
stay free — they back `+` and `*` — and the type-directed families (`fromInt`, `parseInt`, …)
keep their names.

The methods come with the module: any `import std.string { … }` makes them visible, and a file
that needs no free name imports the module under an alias, which avoids shadowing the builtin
type name:

```lyr
import std.string as strings;

fn main(): int {
    return "  Grüße  ".trim().length();
}
```

Two things worth knowing: `s.length()` is a call BECAUSE it costs O(n) — a property would
promise a stored answer this type does not have — and every method returns a NEW string;
`s.trim();` as a statement does nothing, because a Lyric string has nothing to mutate.

## Constructors live on the types

A container comes from its type: `List<int>.empty()`, `Map<string, int>.empty()`,
`Set<int>.empty()`, `StringBuilder.new()`, `Random.seeded(42)` — the latter from `std.random`
since v1.14, where `shuffle`, `choice` and `nextGaussian` live beside it. The old free
functions (`emptyList`, `emptyMap`, `emptySet`, `newRandom`) and the `std.math.Random` twin
went with 2.0.

## Editing the standard library

The toolchain reads the standard library from **beside its own binary** — a copy made at build
time — or from `LYRIC_STDLIB` when that is set. Editing the sources in the repository therefore
changes nothing until the next `dotnet build` refreshes the copies, and a published toolchain
froze its copy when it was packaged. When an edit "is not found", it is almost always this:
point `LYRIC_STDLIB` at the repository's `stdlib/` while working on it.

The library also holds itself accountable: every public item is documented (a test pins
completeness), every file is formatted and compiles without a single diagnostic, and
`stdlib-tests/` carries its behavioral tests — written in Lyric, run by `lyric test`.
